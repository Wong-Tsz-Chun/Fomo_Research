2022-04-25 07:20:16,reddit_post,"A Letter to those who don't have FOMO Dear Friend Who Doesn‚Äôt Suffer from FOMO,

Your mental attitude surprises me. You are unaffected when you go on Snapchat and see the stories that your friends post when they are at a party without you. The same is true when you go on Find My Friends and you see two of your best friends together while you are at home, alone. You don‚Äôt feel like you are missing out on anything special and instead just passively watch, not letting anything get to your head. Maybe you are an introvert and being at large gatherings makes you uncomfortable. I understand how you can find happiness being alone, binging your favorite show.

FOMO, also known as fear of missing out, is a word that eats at my mental health, but not yours. FOMO is defined as the anxiety brought about when you feel like you are missing out on experiences or knowledge. I am someone who always wants to be in the know and wants to be included. Even if I am unable to go somewhere because I have a conflict, I still want the invite. It‚Äôs important to me to feel like I am wanted somewhere, while you can simply appreciate the fact that your friends are having fun.

Given today‚Äôs culture, I am genuinely surprised that you don‚Äôt suffer from crippling FOMO. Social media has perpetuated FOMO. When people go out, they attempt to produce FOMO in others by posting on social media. Maybe you understand better than I do that social media can be deceiving. When I am out and someone I am with posts a video, it can seem like the most fun thing ever, when it often really isn‚Äôt. Plenty of research has shown the negative effects of social media on mental health. You see other people looking like they are having the time of their lives, and you aren‚Äôt.

I really wish that I could just look at something I am left out of and not care. I wish that not being included in something didn‚Äôt leave me with terrible anxiety and feeling somewhat depressed. This feeling is consistent with my tendency to overthink things. Something small often becomes an ordeal in my mind as I construct reasons as to why I am alone or not invited, such as no one wants to hang out with me. This mindset becomes frustrating when someone I always hang out with, or used to, has moved to only hanging out with one of my other best friends.

I recognize that we all struggle with problems and hardships in our lives. I‚Äôm not saying that just because you don‚Äôt have severe FOMO your life is perfect. Instead, it‚Äôs just easy for me to imagine that your life is a little better than mine. I am sure that overcoming an obstacle or struggling with being an introvert is difficult to go through as well. With everything going on in our lives, I admire your ability to be independent. I wish I could happily spend my Friday nights alone without the feeling of FOMO.

One suggestion you might give me to overcome my FOMO is to look at technology and social media less. I know that I need to take a step back from technology, but that is easier said than done. I am simply too obsessed and addicted to technology. To cut technology and social media out of my life is nearly impossible. Another suggestion that I think is more feasible for me is to change my focus. Rather than focusing on not being there, should I be happy for my friends and look forward to being at the next event with them?  Is that your attitude? I understand I need to see things in an optimistic way as opposed to being jealous.

I know you don‚Äôt have similar feelings to me. But, my hope is that you can help change my mindset so that I don‚Äôt constantly experience FOMO. I hope this letter finds you well, and please help me beat FOMO.

Best,

Abby",SoftwareOk1180,48

Go find the answer yourself, even if it means you lose money (just don't waste a lot of money) learn what you want and dislike, if you can find that, then you can have some defense against other people's opinion and not be easily swallowed by the flow of others. 
Also as an additional note, I appreaciate you thinking my life isn't better, because honestly I suck at doing human things and my life is spiraling down a pitfall I am trying to climb out of, I don't know how is yours now but hoping you are doing well or even better than me.",drdoofendhmirtz001,1

2024-06-23 20:38:23,reddit_comment,"what is there to miss out on when everything i need is right here within me?

all i could ever possibly need is a partner, one best friend and maybe children, one day. 

anything beyond that is simply a distraction, entertainment for the mind that i‚Äôm simply not interested in and that truly won‚Äôt matter when i am dead and gone and maybe get to look back on my life.

i obviously only value long term deep relationships and maybe that‚Äôs not the case for you. ask yourself what is it that i am looking for outside of myself? what do i believe i have to look for that doesn‚Äôt exist within me and then realize we all have the ability to give ourself those things. that could be belonging, fun, adventure, acceptance, validation. 

i realized one day that i could give myself those things i looked for in other people more than they could and that there‚Äôs no limit to what i can give to myself. 

after i started living this way, all the things i previously, desperately sought after began to seek me",reddead88888,1

\- find hobbies that you genuinely enjoy that you do by yourself (reading/running) so that you have less time to think 'what could my friends be doing right now'

2024-03-01 23:28:18,reddit_comment,"I really try to be considerate of others. Think of others in light of how you treat others yourself. Do you really expect to be surrounded by people constantly and living it up? There's times you don't always want to hang out with people or times you might prefer a smaller group of people. It's not that you don't like someone just because you aren't personally hanging out with them right at that moment, and most likely, other think the same way. It's not like people dislike you, but people's worlds don't revolve around you being with them. And I think you can find freedom in that. In being your own person with your own needs to meet, and when there's someone else who might be struggling, you may be more equipped to help them. Not sure if this makes sense or is relatable.

2021-09-19 08:33:54,reddit_post,"Fiscally conservative makes me FOMO. I am afraid to spend money and I'm starting to think I don't have a life. I worked as an essential worker and was fortunate to save quite a bit of money during quarantine. In addition to work, I received scholarships from my university and have been saving a decent amount within a year (\~$40,000). While everyone has been partying, eating out and living their life since safety measures have eased out, I'm still resistant towards spending too much. I want to save for a car and have a safety net when I graduate. I want to hopefully save enough money to start investing and possibly put a down payment on a house. 

 My friends say I'm too young (24) to worry so much about money, but I don't like spending my money on nails, makeup, concerts, raves, expensive restaurants etc. like other people my age do. My mind is very future oriented, and I feel like my sacrifices of saving money now will pay off later on. I'm also pretty introverted and enjoy reading, watching TV/youtube, making bracelets and working with other hobbies that allow me to stay home and not spend so much. But, there's this constant FOMO that's always playing in the back of my head because I see others my age doing so much outside (and spending so lavishly). 

Does anyone else feel this way? For those older and have more wisdom, am I too frugal for my own good? I would also love to hear how others have amazing experiences while keeping their wallets in tact.",pixiefairyqueen,3
2021-10-04 10:31:10,reddit_comment,"I'm mid 30's and have done a bit of both. Frugal at some points in my life and very careless at other points. I should add by careless, I just mean I had extra money and I didn't save it/spent it on things I didn't really need. When I was much younger I'd just drain my bank account as long as my bills were paid. 

I think you are just you, and that should be self-honored. Money is just money, but it sounds like it brings you pleasure and comfort to save money more than spend it. Maybe that allows you to feel more secure in the world, relaxed, and prepared for what may come next, whatever may come next. 

I also ask myself if my social life is taking a hit when I hit frugal times. I remind myself I can go out and not spend money with friends and there are many free or low cost activities we can do with friends, but maybe your introversion is counter to that, and that's okay too. If you're truly fulfilled with yourself and your choices, there will be no looking back on your life at this stage to say ""dang I wish I would have spent more money!"". I've never regretted my carelessness or frugalness at least. You get to define what is fun and fulfilling to you, not anyone else. Maybe setting a day, like once a month, to buy something or go out and do something new that costs a few bucks just as a self-experiment and see how you feel. I for instance, would have never gone to a music festival in my younger years, but I finally took a swing and went to one this summer (spent 300 bucks over the whole weekend and tix) and it was well worth the money for me to bond and create deep connections with close friends and new friends! 

Delayed gratification is a great tool for success, but we don't have to sacrifice gratification 100% of the time either. I try to mix both up in my life, fine tuning it as I go. Hope this helps :)",KleganeSandor,1

I like to think myself a smart consumer, so deep down I know that getting ps5 at launch isn't super important when new games are still coming to ps4 anyway. And of course I save a couple hundred that I can use else where for black friday. 

I just need some validation, patient gamers lend me your energy.",animepig,10

I'm perfectly fine with that though, I've still got many games to play on PS4, for example Shadow of War and Hollow Knight that they just gave us for free with Plus. And whenever you get a PS5, you won't have missed anything at all, all the games you want to play will still be there. I'd even say waiting a bit is better cause by the time we get the console we'll already know its problems if it has any, and also which games are worth spending money on and which aren't. There's no hurry at all, I'm sure most people haven't bought the PS5 on launch day especially with how few consoled have been produced for D1 :)",Cantbe4nothing,2

Just a few observations

* You seem convinced that you are doing nothing wrong. I don't think you are looking at the situation objectively.
* I get a sense that you are trying to impress someone or gain their validation.  Stop caring about what people think about you. The harder you try to impress someone the more you will turn them off.  If things don't click that's ok move on.
* Gaining interest has more to do with people letting talk about themselves than try to make an impression",AgnosticPrankster,1

2020-02-22 13:07:24,reddit_comment,"Hey, listen. I‚Äôve talked to a lot of people and the truth is that everyone, in a bigger or smaller manner, suffers FOMO. We humans are guilty of the sin of constantly supposing stuff, instead of seeking the truth. Think about it, all those Instagram or Snapchat stories, they‚Äôre specifically created and orchestrated so that the individuals who are in those pictures look as if they‚Äôre having the time of their lives, because that‚Äôs what they want you to think. But things aren‚Äôt that simple. They never are. That there are some people out there that are GENUINELY having the time of their lives? Yes, of course. But usually those people know themselves and are generally secure and sound individuals. My advice is to simply work on yourself, think of what you want and then change what‚Äôs necessary. And don‚Äôt worry about people so much. They‚Äôre in their own world. Appreciate those who are around you and focus or aim for things that make everything else irrelevant. Cheers",deleted,1

2024-10-28 06:37:38,reddit_post,"Halloween parties and FOMO If anyone is getting fomo right now, let me assure you that parties are not a win for social anxiety. That‚Äôs my opinion after an entire lifetime of secretly wishing I was someone who was invited to parties, finally getting that, and being sent into a depressive spiral after one night. I knew it was stupid to care, but I did, so I said yes to a party where I didn‚Äôt know anyone, got wasted and had an awful time. The entire time I wished I was at home and sober and watching Halloween movies. I stayed long enough for someone my age to tell me that they thought I was 19 (I‚Äôm 23) and asked me why I‚Äôm still in college when I‚Äôm so old, and then laughed when I said I was an art major. It‚Äôs full of tipsy strangers where you have to have the same conversations over and over, it‚Äôs awkward, sweaty, and you feel like shit the day after. I didn‚Äôt even gain friends either, just a headache. 

I‚Äôm posting this because I was manic last year over staying inside and listening to everyone around me on campus laughing and having fun, so this year I thought that feeling would change after going but that wasn‚Äôt true. My therapist told me I should try to think of it as JOMO(Joy of Missing Out) which I‚Äôm starting to put merit in. I heard someone say once that success is not about getting what you want, it‚Äôs being confident because you failed so much and lived through each moment.

2024-08-30 23:23:27,reddit_post,"FOMO and anxiety So, presumably like the rest of you, I get somewhat sad at the mention or sight of romantic relationships, friendships, and sex.  But for some reason this sad feeling has been intensified as of late, and, for me at least, I feel like all of the stated social phenomena are just different when you are young, and so I feel the strong fear of these experiences passing me by. I'm not saying that you can't date, make friends, or have sex when you are older, just that it would be different...somehow.

Anyways because of this fear, a couple days ago I decided that I'd go out just for the sake of it(exposure therapy). I did it today. What's surprising is that my anxiety level was significantly lower than it normally is, like, I could even make a fucking U-turn in front of tons of people without worrying that they'd think I'm a clueless dumbass. It was quite extraordinary the relative ease I had with just walking around aimlessly, basically just existing, just doing my own thing. It's crazy, and I'm not even on any drugs(including psychiatric drugs) or alcohol or anything. Normally when I go out, I'd have to have a reason to do so, I'd have to know where I'm going, how to get there, etc. But today was different. I didn't interact with anybody but that wasn't the point anyway, the point was to just get used to being around people. I'm just worried that this won't last.

Anyways, have any of you had similar experiences? I just wonder whether FOMO could counteract social anxiety.",SucQbus,3

I'm an introvert who has social phobia/social anxiety & battled both my whole life.

Now I'm older (was married for a while/no kids) I enjoy being a loner & I do what I want,when I want so I don't get anxious because I spend most of my time on my own....which I have learned to really like. (TV shows & Sports...massive watcher)

If I need to be in social settings for some reason (apart from food shopping) I use Alcohol if I know I may need to feel more relaxed...not ideal but have done it all my life & because I don't really have to go anywhere & don't live near my parents or 2 sisters I don't need this ""Dutch Courage"" very often....

2024-05-18 12:03:47,reddit_comment,"First of all, why do you feel like this makes you sound like an asshole? Social anxiety is fucking rough and this FOMO is completely valid, don‚Äôt feel bad about experiencing it. Honestly, it could be a good idea to bring this up to your bf, if he tends to be understanding. Just let him know you‚Äôd like to experience more, and maybe he can push you out of your comfort zone.

Otherwise, exposure is really the only way to fix this. Start small, do things that feel less high stakes than a party. And focus on just doing the thing, don‚Äôt worry about how you ‚Äúperform‚Äù. For example, if you talk to the cashier at the grocery store, you‚Äôve already succeeded! Don‚Äôt get hung up on what you said or how you appeared specifically.

2024-01-02 08:59:53,reddit_post,"I had a big realization recently about FOMO and comparisons and how it has affected my social anxiety in the past. Growing up in the age of social media, I used to get really anxious or envious when I would see pictures of other people online showing off their social lives.  Mostly college age people, even ones I don't know well posting pictures of their frat/sorority/house parties every weekend.  Or groups of friends out at a bar or concert, etc.  This sensation of FOMO from looking at other people's ""extravagant"" lives is very common, and a piece of advice I heard a bunch of times, but took a while for me to really get it is to ""stop comparing yourself to other people's lives.""  Which is easier said than done.

This was my big realization.  I wasn't actually doing that, I was comparing myself to *my perception* of other people's lives.

For example, if you look at somebody's FB profile cover photo and it shows them among 10 or 12 college students, how do you know that all of them are best friends and get to see each other all the time?  More likely, some of the people in that hypothetical group don't know each other that well, or don't like each other as much as you would think.  How do you know that their lives are awesome or extraordinary?

I was at a group fitness class once. We were told to lie down and meditate when a couple of girls came in. I was a newbie in the group and they weren't. I lay with my eyes shut doing what I had been told to do. They started asking, ""Who is she?"" I didn't know how to react because they weren't talking to me and instead used third person, so I continued trying to mediate. The girls joked around a little more, eventually saying that ""she"" fell asleep and laughing.

I felt awful. Sports is not my best side, so I'm always very sensitive when someone makes fun of me during exercise. The girls were having a separate conversation, even though it was about me, so I didn't know if I should interfere. Maybe the right thing was to stop the meditation and laugh with them, but I couldn't make myself, I was too upset‚Ä¶

2021-07-30 17:12:27,reddit_post,"Anyone else force themselves to go to social events out of FOMO? Fomo  = fear of missing out.

I wanna keep this short cause If I vent too much then I'll get all ranty and emotional.  I just can't not go to a social event.  I have so much bad social anxiety and worry everyone hates me but if theres a social event, I make myself go. I panic at first but then I slowly ease into the situation and adapt and make new friends. The people I befriend distract me from my thoughts and energize me, they make me  realize that maybe I'm not that weird and that I can make friends.

I usually always say yes to going to a social event for these reasons.  1-  I want to make new friends. 2 - I know itl be fun and I want to have fun.  3 - its energizing despite giving me anxiety.  4 - my friends want me to go I can't disappoint them. 5 - my mum will be sad if I don't go. 6 - I don't want to be anti social. 7 - I don't want to be stuck in my own thoughts all alone. 8- They might gossip about me. 9 - I might miss out on a new dynamic shift.... 

And like at social events providing I am friends with majority of people. Then I end up panicking at first over everything but then I get there, they tease me , I tease them back, we talk video games and memes and have all this fun and I just feel so included.      And its so much better to spending time at home stuck in the thoughts that constantly say that I'm going to get abandoned and that my friends hate me.  Because around the friends, I can clearly see that they are happy (i think they are happy) and that they are having fun and care for me. But when I'm away from those friends, I can't see that....  Maybe thats why I like social events?    And as for new people, I just wanna befriend people because my idea is that if I have all these friends, then I can never be abandoned, because if I lose one friend, I can jump to the next...and then I won't be alone, and then If I stuff up a conversation, then I can try out a conversation with another friend. And If I have all these friends then I can observe them and watch how they talk to people and how they calm down from situations.      

But the truth is, sometimes I don't feel like going to social events, I always have anxiety over them every time yet...once I go, it always goes well and I always have a great time so I might as well go to every single one. But I can't help but feel like its just me wanting validation in the end.      

Anyone else do this? I've never met anyone else that has social anxiety that actively makes themselves go to social situations ever....But I can't help it, not only do I feel incredibly bad for my family and friends who wanted me to go, but I also see it as an escape from horrible mind, and 9 times out of 10 it is.",Opposite-Ant-4403,26

I'm still not doing all that great right now, but what I will say is that you are lucky you're 24 and able to recognize your symptoms. This means you can start looking for solutions sooner than I did.

First, find a therapist. Find one that does CBT and or ACT. it turns out the brain can't be trusted and there are techniques to basically ignore the BS is our heads and continue with life. Both CBT and ACT techniques help with this.

Second, is medication. I'm personally never a fan of meds first or meds without any therapy work. After a few years of therapy my therapist suggested I try meds. It has helped slightly. I'm still looking for a medication that fits for my body chemistry.

Both of these are worth a try. Good luck!",destinationsound,6

For example, there‚Äôs travel organizations that will plan all sorts of trips and adventures for young people locally and globally. They‚Äôre costly but it‚Äôs worth it. You‚Äôll be with a group of strangers who all want to make friends with other strangers so they‚Äôll do the work for you of befriending you. Meetup is a great app for finding events too.


Anyway, having the ability to make new friends when you don‚Äôt have common grounds/schedules to begin with (like you do in school), is an adult life skill we all have to learn. Yeah some people are just rly good at it naturally, but the rest of us gotta learn it‚ÄîESPECIALLY if you‚Äôre the type of person who WANTS to be going on all these adventures.

I just booked a flight to Australia and didn't plan shit. Then you just have to get on the plane and bam, you're completely alone and fucked. But necessity makes you capable of things you couldn't do before. You have to find a place to stay the night. You have to eat. You might end up at a hostel and people will start talking to you. It's stressful as hell but like, I'm so glad I discovered I was capable of travelling on my own. 

When I want to do things but I also don't, I just pay for the thing and make my feet go forward till I'm there and then I have to deal with whatever shit I got myself into. 

I now feel confident travelling alone. However I still can't ask for favours, make phone calls, talk to other women or play laser tag, so I still have a ways to go. This is not advice but maybe worth playing with the idea of in your head if the idea of leaping into the freezing cold deep end appeals to you.

Going to small group training at a gym twice a week also helps with my mental resilience.

Youth is nice since it makes it easier to be in shape and more physically resilient and school makes meeting new people dead easy, but it isn't a magical time that's ""wasting"" if you don't party. Focus on becoming capable of building habits. Go for daily walks in the park to alleviate your fear of being around others and keep that fear at bay. 2 weeks to a month later, join a gym class, church, or other weekly meeting group to start socializing. It will take weekly or daily effort to prevent the fear from coming back. You may need medicine to help. Exercise will help too. Good sleep is important too.

Stop whining. Get off your ass and do something about it. 

Go to therapy. If that is not free in your country and you don't have the money, go to self help groups. Group therapy is so helpful!

Get in touch with your emotions.

Meditate, do autosuggestive affirmations (AT). Journal. Go into the forest and scream until you start crying (may take some tries). Do it *regularly*.

Read. Google the inner child and work with it.

Work on your appearance. Choose a style **you** like, do some kind of sports (even better if it forces you to overcome fear regularly, for me it is Parkour). 

Practice smalltalk. Yes it is bs but see it as a n ecessary  evil. You will get to the good stuff eventually, with the right people (they do exist).

Force yourself to go to parties at some point. Set achievalbe goals, e.g. ""I will go in, buy a drink, drink it and then I may leave if I want to"".

You have to put in the work. Yes, it is unfair. But you have no choice. It's work, push yourself, or else be miserable for the rest of your life. But also cut yourself some fucking slack. Youhave a project that most people don't need to work on. It will cost some time.

2022-04-16 06:16:04,reddit_comment,"It‚Äôs really not what you do, it‚Äôs who you do it with. It‚Äôs hard bc as someone with social anxiety, I‚Äôve always clicked with friends also with social anxiety. And often times those people might not want to go out ever. I was always the person pushing to go out in college and usually there was only one person who‚Äôd be down. But you only need one person. Find a friend you click with‚Ä¶just vibe with and respect. And go out together. Travel together. You‚Äôll be comfortable with them. And maybe eventually your circle can expand. Drag a few extroverts into the mix and boom you‚Äôll start having small parties where everyone is comfortable with everyone..

I hate parties full of ppl I don‚Äôt know. But I love parties where I‚Äôm with ppl I do. Be careful of drinking with social anxiety bc it can get addictive and be a crutch for socializing‚Ä¶but with that in mind, Do a shot before a gathering if you‚Äôre not driving. Be gentle with yourself in these situations. Don‚Äôt push yourself and get drained before you even start. Think about the party very little the hours leading up. Maybe focus on a task like baking a cake or planning cocktails. Make a show of doing your hair or makeup etc and imagine it‚Äôs like your armor. These things help me feel secure in my body and stop my mind from racing. Maybe they‚Äôll help you. And party favors and if others like your baking‚Ä¶these things are great initial I‚Äôve breakers.

If all else fails, be a host. It‚Äôs a lot easier to be comfortable in your own space or something you planned so you‚Äôre not at the whim of others and you have more control.",deleted,0

If we keep doing nothing then the actual social obligations will only be scarier the further removed we are from them.

While an update to the required side effects info in Europe is interesting, it isn't a scientific study. I'm not saying you're wrong, however what I am saying is to believe something to be true without a study proving it to be true and then spreading that info as if it is true, is what's wrong with the internet.

The link you posted is not a scientific study, with a test group, showing the results. All it is, is the government covering all their bases and when there have been some reports of lasting sexual dysfunction issues, there still wasn't any referenced scientific study. 

Furthermore, the language used specifically for the SSRI/SNRI section was, ""There have been reports of long-lasting sexual dysfunction where the symptoms have continued despite discontinuation of SSRIs/SNRI."" Without a scientific study backing this claim up, it's just correlation not necessarily causation.

My point being I'm not a doctor or a scientist. Neither are you. Im also not going to blindly shove a bunch of meds down my throat without questioning it. For me it's last resort. Sounds like it is for you as well. However, I still think it's dangerous to tell someone suffering from depression/anxiety that meds WILL do something when there isn't any conclusive data to show it's true. At the very best saying it ""MAY cause an issue but there's no scientific proof of that yet"" would be the more accurate way to state your concern. This way you aren't scaring someone off from a solution that might just save their life.",destinationsound,2

Honestly, it sucks balls. But, once you are able to break the first barrier, you will feel like you can do anything.

 (1.) Getting totally immersed in the things you love...until the things you love hold more power in the room than what anyone's opinions could possibly be. Passion is powerful...it could be an intuitive gift, a cause you truly believe in, a subject or person you love (or have strong feelings about one way or another)....doesn't matter what it is...When passion applies it's like a patronus deflecting a dementor (aka social anxiety).

(2.) Obviously with social anxiety, what you know to be true intellectually and what you feel doesn't necessarily line up....But it still helps to know what your underlying beliefs/premises are, and change them when they apply.

 General Example: Knowing that there are a shit ton of people out there that are just as self-conscious as you are, makes it kinda obvious that most people are too focused on themselves to be worried about what you're doing. It might not eliminate your self-consciousness entirely, but it helps. 

More personal example: 
After a lot of trauma over the years, I realized I had this underlying thought process that if I wasn't trying to make myself invisible, I wasn't doing enough to protect myself. Somewhere I developed this mistaken idea that blending into the background would save me from future victimization.  It was my attempt to believe I had agency when I'd otherwise have despair. Intellectually I knew these thoughts weren't accurate, but they still dictated how I lived my life for years because I needed a much more powerful thought to grapple with them. 

(I had to shift my focus from ""making myself invisible won't save me"" to ""nobody should have to feel or live like this. Why the hell am I living like this? When I know I'd tell anyone else they were meant to shine and be free. And fuck all the evil people in this world who ever made them feel otherwise."")

If you're trying to grapple with a disparity between what you feel and what you intellectually know is true...often it's not about what's technically true or what isn't. It's whether the truth you're meditating on is powerful enough to overcome the lie you've by for so long. 

(3.) In situations where you as an individual might have the spotlight directly cast on you (I.E. Someone asks your opinion or you're performing a skill solo)..It helps to create thought experiments. 

(These are some that have worked for me.) 

(I.) What if this was my last day on earth? Would I really give a flying fuck about what anyone thought? Or would I just do everything happy and free, knowing any possible judgement or consequence was completely irrelevant? What if I just tried pretending that was true today? What if I just tried it for an hour?

(II.) I would never want anyone else to feel ashamed of the things they loved or be too afraid to try, so Godamnit I'm going to try to be the person I wish everybody could be, even if it's just for today.",whyvswhynot12089,1

2023-03-01 04:00:07,reddit_comment,"100% and it does make me quite sad to be honest. I am a 28, almost 29 year old guy and as I edge closer and closer to 30, I think about what could have been of my 20s especially if it wasn't for my mental health. I remember years ago I made 2 posts on Yahoo Answers when that was still a thing, once when I'm pretty sure I was 18 and again when I was 19. The first post had a title something like ""Another teenage depression story? Yep, sure is!"" or something like that and I basically talked about how I've never had a girlfriend, feeling depressed (my anxiety was lesser at that point), all these dreams I had/kinda still have although it seems less and less likely now. I wanted to be a musician ideally in some rock band and doing acoustic rock stuff too. I dreamt of being known as some kind of music rock legend where all these people I use to know would think something like ""Wow! Theirs that guy we use to mock in school, look where he is now!"" type thing, I'd give deep interviews talking about my life and overcoming my struggles and to offer hope to others out there that they too could be a success and that their is hope. I have always loved listening to Kurt Cobain interviews for instance, really interesting guy, I don't necessarily agree with everything he says but some stuff especially I can relate to i.e. that feeling of isolation and depression.

What makes me sad thinking about them posts I made, is despite having done some things like finish college and getting an IT degree for instance, having a few jobs even if only for the short term (due to not being able to keep them because of my learning difficulties). I still could never get out of these mental health issues or reduce them, in fact they have only really gotten worse since then. I am still a virgin, I still haven't had a girlfriend and that whole partying thing, going to clubs and pubs etc has kinda passed me by without me even trying it, at least partly due to my anxiety. I am grateful to have such loving parents who help me, but I can't help but feel like (and I desperately hope I'm wrong) I'll end up writing posts like that at 38 and 39 years old. I worry since that despite me doing some voluntary work helping people like myself with learning difficulties/disabilities, my lack of being able to find and keep a job due to my learning disabilities (dyspraxia and slow processing speed) and that financial stability aspect along with not having the greatest of looks (something I'd like to work on) will put a lot of woman off. I think I can understand that from their side.

I haven't hung out with a friend in terms of going round to see them and going out together since my friend's 18th birthday and that was in 2012, so I know I need to build a friend group locally to me apart from my online gaming friends who I talk to a lot. I am hopefully going to meet a woman about my age I know soon who I've just met recently so that's a start at least, it isn't a date, just hanging out. Another trouble is I live in a small rural town with a largely elderly population so finding friends and especially single women my age doing stuff other than clubbing is pretty tough. Sometimes you get the feeling that your cards just haven't lined up in the way you'd hoped they would and you can get quite lonely and down about it but I'm trying to take small steps at a time to improve. One problem is the motivation and will to improve, I'd love to get better at motivating myself but hopefully the more I do, the more I will want to do. I also try to go on walks pretty regularly to improve my physical fitness, mental health and just to do some exercise. A long long way for me to go, but I think we can all get there. All the best and sorry if the long post annoys you :).",AWanderingFlameKun,1

I remember a lot of that time when depression was at its worst, and just remembering it some days causes panic attacks, but some days are nice. Running, long walks, and food help. I cut out marijuana because it's gotten to where it hurts more than it helps, and I'm currently negotiating myself on alcohol, to either quit or at least cut back more. I'm usually ok during the week, but on weekends I tend to drink more than I should, and alone, but I've found that cutting that out without a replacement 'escape' isn't practical either, so I'm unsure how I want to proceed with that one. Still, I'm not doing too badly. Have been far worse! I'm open to doing more, I just... am not great with most people. Feels like I grew up on another planet most of the time, and I'm waaaaay too accustomed to being on my own.",s0mnambulance,1

People with social anxiety want to have friends and relationships and experiences, but their anxiety makes it so they can't. This desire for friends and experiences manifests as a fear of missing out when you don't have them. The anxiety is all centered around the same thing: wanting to be with people but being afraid of them. I honestly don't think you could have social anxiety without some distress over missing out on stuff.

On the other hand, in Schizoid personality disorder, people don't interact with others at all but it's because they don't want to. The outer behavior between the two look pretty much the same, but someone with schizoid does not have the fear of missing out because they don't want to be with people.",deleted,2

And the thought that it just gets worse from here on out makes my heart beat fast and I get really anxious and depressed.

The only thing that really helps is to put it in perspective; there are always others much worse off than I - homeless, starving impoverished people, imprisoned, child slaves, victims of war, torture, extreme violence, severely disabled/disfigured, mentally insane...

2021-05-15 04:27:25,reddit_post,"Are you dealing with FOMO anxiety and need some tips to cope? The feeling of FOMO, or fear of missing out, is an anxiety that many people suffer from. Typically when you feel this way, you are worried about the opportunities that are passing you by because you aren't doing anything with your time. This can lead to a lot of stress and even depression.

**However, there are ways to deal with it so that it doesn't get worse.**

*Research shows that a fear of missing out can stem from unhappiness and dissatisfaction with life and that these feelings can propel us into greater social media usage.*

In turn, greater engagement with social media can make us feel worse about ourselves and our lives. In this way, it helps to know that our attempts to alleviate feelings of FOMO by engaging more on Facebook or Instagram can actually lead us down a rabbit hole into feeling even less self-accepting than before! It's important then develop strategies for dealing with the problem in order not to experience those same negative emotions over time.

**1. Change your focus.**

When you're feeling down or uninspired, try a little mind shift. Rather than focusing on what we lack, let's notice the many things that are already in our lives to be grateful for! It may not feel like it at first when your social media feed is full of people who have more time and money than us bragging about their latest vacations--but with some effort, anyone can make changes to get back into the groove. Add positive friends; block out those others less supportive (or worse: negative). Ignore them by scrolling past before they start making you feel worse instead of better!

**2. Keep a Journal**

It is common to post on social media to keep a record of the fun things you do. However, you may find yourself noticing a little too much about whether people are validating your experiences online. If this is the case, you may want to take some of your photos and memories offline and keep a personal journal of your best memories, either online or on paper.

Keeping a journal can help us move away from our focus on public approval into a private appreciation for what makes life great; which may, in turn, get out of cycles like social media.

**3. Seek Out Real Connections.**

When we feel lonely or excluded, our brain is trying to tell us that it needs more connections with people and a greater sense of belonging at its core. It is actually healthy to seek out more connections with others and increase our sense of belonging. It may sound like the ultimate catch-22 but in reality, this human need has been around for centuries before there were even people on Earth!

Making plans with a good friend, creating a group outing, or doing anything social that gets you out with friends can be a nice change of pace. It puts the focus on what matters most to you and makes it feel like your life has some forward momentum again.

**4. Focus on Gratitude**

Take some time out of your day and pick a person or thing in which you find gratitude, then write it down on paper. Afterward, take the list that you wrote them down on and go around telling people what they are thankful for about these things! It's amazing how much this can bring up happiness within an individual as well as those who were told by someone else what is great about their life too!

**It's normal to experience FOMO, but we should take actions to deal with it**.

If any of these tactics sound helpful but still feel overwhelming, reach out for help! I'd love to chat with you one-on-one and see how we can get you back on track so that you don‚Äôt let FOMO dictate where your time goes. Just text me and I would be more than happy to schedule a call with you (it's free).

2019-03-31 12:32:33,reddit_post,"I get FOMO at the thought of going out to bars but I get nervous trying to talk to people when I do go out Right now I live in the quiet suburbs. I have a group of core friends I met in college. We all made a plan to go bar hopping once a month, every month in the city. 

Another problem with me is that I always get FOMO. I always assume I'm missing out on the greatest time of my life if I miss something and that everyone else is having fun, enjoying their youth. I feel horrible if I miss a night out with my friends because I feel like I'm really missing out on drinking, spending time with them, and what not. I assume that all those young people in their 20s are living it up and having a blast and I want to be part of it too. 

 But when I do go out, I'm counting down the minutes and hours until I get to go home and be alone with the internet. When I do go out, it feels like a chore, and being out surrounded by other people who are more good looking than me or better dressed is mentally draining. I feel like I recharge my mental drain by being alone in the comfort of my room. 

I get nervous talking to people I don't know when I'm in these settings. If I'm at work and I talk to a client, I feel fine since I have a reason to talk to them, its about work. But if I approach a stranger in a totally social setting, I feel like my brain leaves my head and I run out of things to say after ""Hi"". I feel stupid for approaching people in a purely social setting, as if its totally obvious I want to make friends and that I look stupid for doing so. I have no problems with keeping an infinite conversation with friends and people I know, I just get so nervous around people I dont know. 

A part of this FOMO makes me want to move to the city, where all the fun is. I feel like young people like myself are having an awesome time in the city and I'm missing out by living here in the suburbs. A part of me wants to move to the neighborhood where all the young people live and have fun. But I get so anxious that if I move to the young people section near where all the bars and restaurants are, then I'll feel a big sense of FOMO if I don't go out every weekend, with the knowledge that all that fun is happening just blocks from where I would potentially move into.

I thought that wasn't right but they said that the elders get the overulling for things like that. And I still think it isn't right becuz then the younger sis never gets a fair ruling even when it's hers.

So I decided that when I get a house one day, I'll only have rooms for the kids and their space and not have guests spend the night unless they want to sleep in the living room. But other than that, they need to be somewhere else becuz I don't want anyone having to sacrafice their comfort in their own home.

You can go out somewhere alone or just chill at home and watch horror movies, shows, anime, etc., or play a horror game. I'm sorry you'd have to do so alone, but try not to let the lack of company ruin festive fun.

If you have the means, maybe you could try streaming something. That might help you interact with others, and it would even be at a distance. If you have a good PC or laptop, all you'd need is OBS (it's free), a Twitch account, a steam account and possibly a capture card (if it's not a PC game).",deleted,8

About a month ago, I was all alone on my birthday. I went out to eat with my family then went home to drink by myself. No friends. No party. Just a celebration of 27 years with but one close friend. I felt ashamed of my own existence as well tbh.

Then I booked a trip out of the blue ( I know not everyone can do this) but the logic behind it was I may feel like dying‚Ä¶ But still have a lot of this world to see and I‚Äôll be damned if I kill myself before that happens. 

I booked a trip to Mexico and surprise surprise, my social anxiety followed me. I‚Äôve been here for 5 days alone and just chatting with random strangers in passing that I can‚Äôt really consider friends but were nice to talk to. They‚Äôre here from around world yet they‚Äôre more open to conversation than a lot of people I know from back home IMHO.

I‚Äôm still very anxious down here and I still haven‚Äôt really approached people just walking up to talk. But I‚Äôm so happy that I did this and go out my comfort zone.

Maybe she was a loner like me, maybe she could have done with someone to hang out with at lunchtime, maybe she would've told me to fuck off, now I'll never know. And what did I have to lose? Nothing, the worst that could have happened is I get turned down. One day I was late to math class and she was sitting at a table alone, there were no others available so I sat next to her and we shared a textbook and didn't say one word to each other. Looking back on that I can't believe what an enormous blithering moronic idiot I was, I mean come on I didn't say anything, not even hi, I could have at least said hi, what the hell was the matter with me? Afraid of being shot down? Well it would've been more than worth the risk but no I'm just a big dumb idiot.

Also I would have gone to university and got an interesting job and I wouldn't be living this stupid miserable dead end life that I'm living now.

I had only 1 semester in college after 2¬æ years in online college! I was determined to come out of my comfort zone and maybe didn't have a drastic change, but I'm glad I tried. 

In the beginning I sat in the last seat, avoiding eye contact, not interacting, not even facing people who sit beside me, freezing in 1 position for hours,  avoiding eye contact with professors or students, just tried my best to not be noticed and went all numb when I got attention of any sorts. I love games, but I dont dare enter our campus gameroom because it's crowded. 

I'm at the end of this semester now, just a week or 2 left. I'm no social guru now, but I sit in the first seats, interact with professors, share my ideas (and it's still nerve-racking when I speak up, but I push through the feeling to improve. I small talk with anyone I know in the campus hallways, I've presented in a class of 160+ students (alot of stuttering, alot of uhms and alot of regret but I'm glad I stepped up), I go to the gameroom to play if I want to play (I still am working on this because I only go when there are less students in), I've also made a few friends whom I talk to everyday, not very close tho because I dont need a best friend, I have my sister u/anxiouslyintrovert whom I can talk to about anything even when nervous. But I found a friend who is just as anxious as I am. Me and my sister share social anxiety too, but we often just motivate each other to do better but with this friend of mine, I understand her position and often end up taking the initiative to enter social interactions FOR her which kinda helped me. 

So overall, I'm glad I tried even when I didn't think anything would change. So I'd want you to try regardless of how ineffective it may seem now. It will be worth it in the long run.",IamLame_Throwaway,2

Exactly. You can be with the nicest people but the anxiety can still cause irrational fears. I helped volunteer at this place and part of my job was helping customers load things into their car. One customer was this sweet older lady, nothing dangerous/suspicious about her. But if I were to be in her home, that's a different territory and with somebody I don't know.

But whenever they do, I always feel this uncomfortable feeling in my stomach. Like I don't want them here or I feel too tired, too weak to even do anything. 

Note that I'm an introvert plus I'm shy and quiet, so it's hard for me to say what I want without feeling that sort of anxiety within me. They always call, and I always make up excuses not to go or not to invite them home. Sometimes, these excuses don't work and they're always persistent to come, but I just don't have the energy to do that.

I see them almost all the time, all I want to do for my weekend is to spend my free time at home and do what I want without the need to please or entertain someone. And it's hard to say that without them feeling like I don't want to be with them. And I get it, I have no life, they do. They're busy 24/7, and I have a free time more than they do, but there is always this uncomfortable and heavy feeling inside of me whenever we hang out.

I‚Äôm a 20-year-old male who recently moved to another city for higher studies. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with social anxiety for the past three years and with depression for almost a year. Seeing my flatmates join dating apps, I thought I‚Äôd give it a try, hoping to find someone I could feel comfortable talking to. I‚Äôm not very good-looking, so matching with girls was rare. However, about a month ago, I matched with a girl who mentioned she was looking for someone to help with her psychology practicals. I offered to help her with social anxiety or depression, given my own experience.

We started chatting online, and it was going well. In the second week, she asked me to go to the movies with her. Even though I was anxious, I agreed. The outing went fine (we didn‚Äôt talk much), but for me, it felt like a huge, mentally draining task. I mentioned this to her, and since she knew about my anxiety, she was okay with it.

We went to the movies again recently, but this time I felt even more drained and had a headache. Now, I‚Äôm in a dilemma‚Äîwhy am I putting myself and her through this? Am I just doing it because of FOMO? Probably. Should I tell her that things might not be working for me, or should I keep going?

P.S. We‚Äôve only texted; we haven‚Äôt talked on the phone either.

TL;DR: I‚Äôm a 20-year-old with social anxiety and depression who moved to another city for higher studies.

i don't have many friends, and 90% of them are friends i met on discord. these are all close friends of mine who i voice chat and play games with nearly every day. we even do facecam often (well, they do.. i've only turned my cam on a couple of times ever because i don't want them to think that i'm ugly). most of them are special friends whom i care about dearly.   
  
these friends have been planning an IRL weekend meetup (we all live in different states), and multiple times i have been asked to join the meetup. the main coordinator of the meetup especially wanted me there and said he wanted to meet me the most (purely platonic). despite this, i could not get over my own shame and self-guilt. i declined to go on the trip because i'm terrified that they will notice all of the things i hate about myself. my stupid teeth, my old looking face, my butt that is too wide for my thin figure, my annoying voice that will sound different to them off mic, my boring emotionless face, the list goes on. basically i'm afraid they will think less of me after meeting me. their illusion of the ""me"" they may have envisioned in their heads will be shattered.

so yeah, i didn't go. instead i'm sitting at home while our discord server is dead silent. only one of them has messaged me during their meetup and they sent me some pictures of them at the beach. it looks like so much fun and i'm also feeling major FOMO and have been dealing with pangs of anxiety every time i remember they're all hanging out together right now. without me.

to make matters worse, i unfortunately developed a pretty strong crush on one of my friends. so now that he's meeting up with the others, including one of the girls he's close friends with, im kinda freaking out about it. but it's like, he would never like me that way anyway so why should i care if something happens between them? why do i feel jealous, when i know i dont deserve his attention in the first place..?

i'm not sure what i hope to gain from posting this. at the very least, another human being might read this and understand how i feel, maybe? i just want to stop feeling like i'm fking crazy. i want people to like me. i want to feel confident in myself but i keep pushing literally every opportunity away just to protect myself. if nothing happens to me ever, then i wont feel as much hurt. right...?

sorry, **tl;dr**: close online friends invited me to a meetup, i declined because im scared they'll be disgusted by me. and now i'm feeling really depressed thinking about them having fun without me. i'd just like some thoughts on this, i guess. thanks for your time <3",little_ukulele01,13
2024-07-13 12:52:29,reddit_post,"At a summer camp type thing and struggling to get friends... I think? This post is ending up very long, so be warned. This is partially a vent, and partially me asking for some advice. I'll leave a tldr for the questions I ask.

So I'm at a month long school-camp thing, and am not gonna go home for a few weeks. There's all these people here, and I want to try to actually meet people this time. And I think I have, maybe? There are some people here who talk to me regularly and say hi to me and I'll say hi to them, and like every now and then we'll talk. But I feel like I'm just so awkward with every conversation I have, and I guess that's just the nature of meeting new people most of the time but because I'm so awkward after the social interaction I feel so dumb and like I failed it. How do I stop being so awkward? I feel like I run out of things to say immediately, so it's hard to have any conversation long enough to actually get to know the person.

Another problem I've been having is serious FOMO. Every night I can hear people hanging out in the lounge areas in the dorms, some of which are people I talk to. I want to have experiences like that this month, like hanging out late with a group of people my age. I don't do anything like that a lot so I want to experience it. But I hold myself back because I can't technically know if anyone would want to talk to me. Even with the people I know somewhat, I'd like to hang out with them but they already have their own people so I don't know how to go about like joining them. 

This is a more niche thing. I'm trans ftm, and for the first time am able to be in male dorms. It's really exciting, and also terrifying. I go to an all girl's school, so I don't have a lot of experience making male friends but it is something I have really needed for a while. I think that is really adding to the stress. It's not just FOMO, but also dysphoria. If anyone reading this is trans, can you relate? Do you have any advice for navigating the social norms of your desired gender when you haven't exactly been raised in it? If there are any cis guys willing to help me out with this, can you give any pointers on how men communicate? I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing, which I think is also making me weirder to people around me. 

tldr: How do I not run out of things to say? How do I get to know people? How do I hang out with people? How do I communicate with men specifically?

2024-05-31 00:00:43,reddit_post,"how do you cope at social gatherings and parties? Hi everyone!! This is my first post on here, I‚Äôm hoping to find someone who can relate to this post and suggest some ways for me to cope and get over some of my social struggles. I have a large circle of friends and I enjoy going out and seeing people. I struggle quite badly with FOMO and the fear of being forgotten, so sometimes I will go out just so that I don‚Äôt have to deal with the FOMO. But I often find that while I‚Äôm at a social gathering, my anxiety will get triggered and I find it difficult to enjoy myself. I might get triggered because I struggle with low self esteem and suddenly become very self conscious and scared of saying or doing the wrong thing, and sometimes my anxiety is triggered due to past turbulence in my friend group which has left me feeling paranoid and uncomfortable. But then I cannot shake that anxious feeling. I don‚Äôt like to ask people for support because I feel guilty and like a burden and I don‚Äôt want to spoil the party for anyone. Almost like it‚Äôs unacceptable to be anything but happy? For that same reason, I don‚Äôt want anyone to see that I‚Äôm struggling. So I then feel like I can‚Äôt take myself outside in case someone sees me and works out that I‚Äôm not okay, because I don‚Äôt want to kill the vibe or make things awkward. My boyfriend tries really hard to support me whilst trying to have a nice time, but my lingering anxiety can stress him out and then my anxiety turns to guilt and worries around him. I feel so controlled by my anxiety because if I stay at home, I‚Äôll get bad FOMO (and sometimes anxiety attacks), but if I go out I sometimes get triggered and then spend most of the time struggling and not knowing how to regulate myself. I just want some ideas of things I could do to regulate myself in a big social setting so that my anxiety doesn‚Äôt linger or stress out my boyfriend, and then I can get back to enjoying myself? Thank you so much for reading ",Frightened_Monkey,1
2024-05-31 00:52:59,reddit_comment,"Hello, I also struggle with social settings. I‚Äôm used to going to smaller gatherings rather than larger ones, but hanging out and conversing with people I know tends to help. I don‚Äôt often venture into new groups unless someone approaches me and I usually stick to casual conversations. If someone mentions something that I enjoy, then sometimes I‚Äôll jump into the conversation. If you ever feel overwhelmed or anxious, it‚Äôs okay to walk away from any large groups for a couple of minutes; I tend to go outside or excuse myself to the bathroom and listen to a few songs until I feel ready to go back into any social gatherings. A few other things that help me is picking an object or color that can be easily seen in the room and counting how many I can find.",Neptune_94,1

2024-05-07 19:13:21,reddit_post,"social anxiety to do with comparisons, feeling loser vibes everyday I usually just have mood swings (Bipolar 1) and depressive phases, I have gotten over social anxiety and anxiety for a long time, maybe when public speaking sometimes, but even then I was chill. Recently though, I have seen my friends graduate college, and I will be graduating three years later, I graduated HS late, and spent a lot of time partying. I missed some people's 21st bdays due to being unorganized and now iM having ALOT OF ANXIETY ABOUT LIFE. I feel always so behind, and I feel fomo with evrything , not vising my friends' colleges before they graduated, not being on the same level, not getting As in college as I said I would change but being so perfect is fucking hard, FOMO on partying since I put it on the back shelf, yet I feel like I would be too old for it later. I just keep having the worst thoughts like Imissed the best days of my life because I chose to be an alcoholic early on, drop out, and now I'm behind everyone, and even thought I WILL GRADUATE COLLEGE LATE, IT WILL HAUNT ME. I will still be older than other students around me, and I mostly am (I'm 22 and a freshmen transfer) and I feel like I need to stop partying now to gt my life in order but will regret that as later most people will quit partying get married settle down. It feels no matter how I live life i fuck up and I want to stay true to myself, I want to have fun, I want to still work on my hobbies, which is making films about characters in NYC, or interviwing people on the streets, but I feel like that too will stop me from graduating college soon as it's all distracting and gets me warped into another world, not an academic one. I just keep feeling no matter what I do I will feel behind, maybe in terms of work accomplishments, dating, graduating etc, its all making me want to lock myself in a room and scream everyday as I missed out on all these birthdays and graduations and I didnt even have any of my own cause of my anxiety and comparison syndrome. At the same time Im not sure if graduating with everyone, at the time I predicted and having coorporate work accomplishments would make mehappy. Its like maybe I would want to have my own path and being att the same level with everyone would be boring. I do feel very motivated to be honest, to do well in school now, be on school teams, make fresh friends in the current environment to stop comparing to my highschool friends, etc, BUt the anxiety that I will always be behind in every way no matter what, and will fail at my own personal dreams and will always feel fomo comparing myself to other people's college experiences, work pace, dating, instagrams, partying etc, will always kill me. I used to not have mad anxiety, but being behind, starting at graduating late in highschool, has really made me go crazy. Now I wish I went to another highschool but I cant change that. I wish I partied less, but I cant change that and probably would have the opposite regret, if on another path right now. i wish I cared more about grades, But only can fix that moving forward. However I have made lists about everything i sucked at and failed at, lost, missed opportunities, all the bad grades I got, all the good projects I did do but lost etc, I just keep repeating in a circle without really fixing my atittude and living in the present. I have made a list of 100 regrets, all these birthdays I have missed, all these school things I missed, all the hopes I had wantd to accomplish by 21 I missed. Life is a shocker, and I dont want to keep zoning out in front of my new friends at my new school but I keep thinking 100 what ifs I went to college w my hs friends earlier, what if I had better grades, would I be in community college right now? What if I was more talkative in school before, wht if I didnt party and do this drug, what if I was still friends with this person? What if I am this anxious of a failure the rest of my life? AND then a hand swoops in front of me, asking if Im okay. Im zoning out in my new college as its a new change and I feel so shitty about myself. I will keep going down this path if I dont fix my attitude and before I know it will be graduated late not remembering anything because I was so negative. Plz someone tell me life gets better after a bunch of fucks up in the earlys 20s and that there are ways to minimize this level of anxiety and fomo and comparison. To me the only way to do it would be in talk therapy everyday or live in a cave cuz at this point social media, being in a new school, seeing everyone do better than me, hating myself, and not even enjoying the present sucks so much I cant even breathe sometimes!

I think the key honestly is just to start trying new things. Don‚Äôt just say yes to everything. Make sure you comfortable. But start saying yes every once in awhile. 

About a year ago, my sister and BIL invited me to go bouldering with them at the climbing gym. I was so nervous but I agreed to go. I went and had a great time. Now I go climbing on my own and have no anxiety about going to the climbing gym. Finding this new hobby has also given me something to work towards.

When it was days away, my anxiety got so bad just thinking I‚Äôd be alone at a concert again. I was overthinking the night before. I felt like none of my clothes looked cute and I was developing body image issues from trying all my clothes on. Then I started stressing about the parking situation. I tried so many times to shrug the internal monologue off and I told myself to commit and go. But then the guilt of not studying for a very important exam came up. I sold my ticket back to Ticketmaster‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve been doing so well the last few years with my social anxiety. The last time it was bad was when I was living abroad. I isolated myself mostly due to the language barrier and men who constantly made me feel uncomfortable just being a girl in public. I realize it gets bad when I have big exams to study for too. I‚Äôve been focusing and isolating myself for 2 weeks now, but in the back of my mind I knew there was a chance it would come back. All last year I went to movies and concerts by myself and I had this rush of freedom. I didn‚Äôt worry about parking so much or what I was wearing. I just wanted to let myself experience things and be present.

I was so afraid to taking it to next step, even noawadays, girls assume I'm a douchebag bc I kinda panic when that part comes so I might do unreasonable things to avoid the person I was into, like ghosting.

Sometimes I might have some bizarre thoughts that I kinda thinks are somewhat reasonable or I'm either doubting of it, like ask some whos working to hang out (as a consumer) and other weird interactions. I think thats mostly because I tend to exagerated and think things like ""Ohh, I'll never meet someone like her ever again"" or ""I'm missing an opportunity, I might never see her again"", even post my first interaction with person. Does anyone relate? Any thoughts to help me?",ToninjaBR,1
2024-03-08 02:46:36,reddit_post,"Social Anxiety and/or something else I think I have really weird social behaviors and I don‚Äôt even know how are they connected. 
First, I have strong anxiety over interpersonal relationship. I am constantly thinking about how people that I categorize as ‚Äúfriends‚Äù see me and whether they truly treat me as friend. It feels much like mental exercises. It‚Äôs really easy for me to think that my acquaintances and friends ‚Äúactually hate me‚Äù until I find some proof of the opposite. 
Second, straight out FOMO. For example, I am spending my spring break in my dorm and I feel really anxious about it because everybody else will be somewhere else(going home or traveling)
Third, I feel lonely almost all the time, but I can‚Äôt get close or even spend a lot of time with another human being. If I spend a lot of time hanging out with another human being, I start to feel annoyed and disgusted by them even if they are being nice and everything. 
All of the above stresses me out till the point that I chose self-harming to cope with them. Then I feel pretty stupid to harm myself over them.
I feel like I don‚Äôt want any intimate connection with anybody‚Äîone to two ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù type of thing. I just want a bunch of friends who only want me in hangouts and parties, and this is pretty weird.
I just want to share and have some opinions from others. Anything is greatly appreciated!

Leaving your comfort zone is scary. But it doesn't need to be

This post will help you if you are someone that struggles to get out of your comfort zone.   
  
I remember when I was super unconfident.  
I was super socially anxious.  
It was a tough life.  
  
I remember being in school, and I would be unable to speak to who I wanted, when I wanted, how I wanted.  
  
I saw a girl, and I would scared to speak to her.  
  
Why though!  
  
It‚Äôs because it was outside of my comfort zone.  
  
Me, a boy of 13 at the time, was amongst the other guys, who all wanted to talk to girls to‚Ä¶  
And some of them did.  
This hurt, and in-turn, made me jealous.  
  
In the end of the day, we all have our own desires for going out of our comfort zone, and for me (at this time), it was to speak to girls.  
  
For some of you, who may be girls reading this (and this applies to guys too), you want to go out of your comfort zone, so that you can live your life.  
  
You feel like your living life as a shell of what you could be (just like how I felt in the past), and it hurts.  
You want to be better  
  
Because all you feel right now is the FOMO of how everyone else is ‚Äúenjoying their life‚Äù, while your scared to go out of your own way to ‚Äúlittle bubble‚Äù, that is holding you back  
  
Leaving the comfort zone is scary.  
  
It‚Äôs like being in a nice warm bath‚Ä¶ at least it CAN be.  
  
It‚Äôs not always nice, because sometimes, you fail.  
  
It can be nice to be in the ‚Äúwarm bath,‚Äù but there are also times when you are really badly wanting to leave, because the bath ‚Äústarts to get cold.‚Äù  
  
I‚Äôm talking about when your in a social situation: imagine, for example, your a guy (or girl), and your out on the streets, or fields, of where you live  
  
And you see someone  
You see someone that you want to talk to  
You have the initial ‚Äúspark‚Äù - that idea, to leave the warm bath, and go and speak to the person that you‚Äôve just seen  
  
But you feel fear.  
  
And so, rather than going to speak to them as soon as you get the idea, you just wait and wait.  
That ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù is something that you probably do very often  
  
You get the desire to go and do that thing that you want to do, or speak to that person that you want to speak to, but you get scared, and so your brain starts to panic.  
  
You start to debate, over and over, whether it‚Äôs actually a good idea to go do it.  
  
You wait, 10 seconds.  
20 seconds.

2 minutes.  
10 minutes.  
  
And then,  


it‚Äôs too late.  
  
This makes you feel awful, because you know that you‚Äôve just lost to your anxiety again.  
So, I want to help you with that :)  
  
The first thing to understand, is that around ‚Äú90% of problems are solved by problem definition.‚Äù  
  
So, you know how your so scared to leave your comfort zone - to go and speak to that person you want to speak to, or do that thing that you do badly want to do, because you want THE FREEDOM to be able to do it.  
  
Well, you‚Äôre scared for a certain reason.  
  
When I used to get anxious in the past, and was scared to speak in school, to ask to go to the toilet, I had no idea about ‚Äúproblem definition.‚Äù  
  
I had no idea that all of my fear could have been eased.  
It‚Äôs simple.  
But most people don‚Äôt do it.  
  
You should journal about your fears that you have.  
Journalling is great, and I love it. I do it every night before bed to break down and relax before bed, as it‚Äôs great for mental health.  
  
But it‚Äôs also amazing for finding out about yourself.  
  
Most people think that they are anxious to go and go out of their comfort zone because they are just scared of ‚Äúone thing‚Äù (example: the girl they want to go and walk up to)  
When really, they are scared of so many things.  
  
They are scared of what everyone else will think of them in that room, or place.  
So journal about all of the different things that you are scared of.  
  
In the end, you are just scared that you are going to ‚Äúfail‚Äù at whatver it is that you want to do.  
Side point: journalling is also really great for this - journal about the different alternative futures that you are scared of becoming ‚Äúreality.‚Äù This is called ‚Äúfailure forecasting.‚Äù And once you do it (even once) it will significantly reduce your social (and ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù) anxiety in the world, and will make you feel so much more secure.  
  
Why?  
  
It‚Äôs because you are more ‚Äúaware.‚Äù  
Humans are scared of something‚Ä¶  
  
We are all scared of the ‚Äúunknown‚Äù (and not to mention, the scary thing we call ‚Äúfailure.‚Äù)  
So by becoming aware of what we are afraid of, and reminding ourselves that it it‚Äôs ok if we fail, in the process, we can improve our ability to ESCAPE OUR COMFORT ZONE AND LIVE THE LIFE WE HAVE ALWAYS DREAMED OF  
  
Sorry for the shoutingüòÖ‚Ä¶ but I really hope this post helps you.  
It‚Äôs just that I have a higher ‚Äúthreshold‚Äù compared to the average person, because I have trained my anxiety.  
  
I remember being so scared of talking to people. I was always so scared, because it felt like everyone would judge me. I remember sitting in class, and just wanting to have my anxiety go away, so that i could speak out, in front of the class, or just do simple things, that everyone else seemed to be able to do so easily‚Ä¶  
  
You know what i mean, right? Its like how, you watch everyone around you, and they all look, and seem to be happy, and speak so much.  
  
It makes you feel insecure, sad (and also way more anxius), because you seem all alone, and like the only person who is struggling with this, and feeling this way.  
  
And this is one of the ‚Äútools‚Äù that really helped me. And i hope it always helps you.  
I completely understand why you feel anxious to go out of your comfort zone, though. It does get better  
  
Way better‚Ä¶  
  
Ang guess what even though I‚Äôm giving you these tips, I still feels this myself, whenever I go and try leave my comfort zone.  
You can leave your comfort zone way easier using this :)  
Hope this helps you",DanielTheTeacher05,1
2023-01-09 16:54:06,reddit_post,"Is it okay to miss a week of school due to social anxiety and depression? Hello!

I am a junior in high school and have struggled with anxiety my whole life, but it especially got bad over the last two years, which made me depressed. I usually NEVER miss school because I tell myself to push through it and I will be okay (also FOMO), but it always circles back to this horrific feeling; of constant hopelessness, uselessness, and unhappiness. It scares me because I freak out and cry for hours because of how intense my anxiety has become. 

School is back, and I realized for the past two years that this school constantly makes me feel so uneasy whenever I enter; I feel so trapped and like everything is against me. I have to take breaks throughout the day because I freak out, turn red, and run to take deep breaths in the restroom. Then for the rest of the days, I feel on the edge and have heart palpitations, and headaches until I finally get home. My parents love me so much, but it's hard for them to grasp this being a good reason to miss school, I have felt miserable for the past weeks; by self-isolating, constantly crying, breaking down, feeling guilty, and just having so many negative thoughts. People may say I need to go to school to face my fears, but I have been doing that for two years and I always end up in this depressive state again. I don't know what it is, and I feel so alone and lost. I grew up in a household to put success first, and I have done that for years, but now I think I just burnt out and exploded and finally realized that I am not okay. How should I convince my parents it's okay? Am I doing the right thing by putting my mental health first?",No-Promotion8915,40

2023-01-09 19:35:55,reddit_comment,"I had SO much anxiety throughout school. I'm 34 now. üò© Especially high school. I would skip classes and sit in the lunch room sometimes. I'd skip gym and sit in the locker room, I'd skip school and hang out in my basement until I got caught...it was really bad. My parents didn't get it. They thought I was just rebelling, being lazy, whatever excuse they could think of...and I didn't know how else to explain what I was feeling. They didn't understand because they weren't me, and didn't feel what I felt. My dad was extremely popular in highschool, he did great in school, and is very successful in his career. He thinks being successful in life is all about how much money you make. Although, now, his tune has changed since his mom passed away. He's realized that life is more than money and work, and regrets a lot of things. He's become an alcoholic. üòî He was physically and emotionally abusive to my brothers and I when we were younger. (when I was 11-16) another reason why I became so shut out from the world, anxious and didn't trust people. I turned to drugs instead. I dropped out of high school my junior year. I couldn't take the anxiety anymore. I became an addict at 17. I had also been se#ually a##aulted at 13, and again on my 21st birthday. My dad kicked me out when he found out I was using. Told my mom to stop talking to me too. I couldn't even talk to her for years. They completely abandoned me. It really hurt, after all the things he had done to me, he just threw me away. He never even apologized. Now I've been clean for five years, and have my own business, and now he's the alcoholic, and I'm sober. It's a sad turn of events. But, if I could go back in time, I wouldn't have even cared what any of those people thought of me in high school. I'd just get my school work done, talk to the people I liked, enjoyed the sports I liked, gotten a part time job, and started saving up. Because you'll probably never see any of those people again after high school. That almost always happens. People grow up and move on. They go to college, start families, move away, etc. None of those people even matter. And if ANYONE bullies you, LAUGH at them, or kick them in the ballsüòÜ call them morons and walk away. Let them know they don't phase you. Just walk around like you have the confidence of a queen, even if you don't. Seriously, try it for a day and see how you feel after. Just one day. Try it. Talk to your friends, do what you have to do, and try to have fun with it. Even pretend like it's a game if you have to. Like you're going to level up after each day. And you win something if you complete the day with the least amount of anxiety as possible. Because SERIOUSLY, it WONT matter in another couple years. And I know that sounds like such a long time now...but it's not. The years are flying by now...it seems like I was just in high school...and I'm 34...I feel so old...but my mind still feels the same as it did back then, I'm just a lot more mature. Be more mature than them. You already seem to be. Screw other people. They don't matter. You do. Family does. Your life does. Do what YOU want to do with YOUR life. That's all that matters. What your parents want for you doesn't matter. What your friends want for you doesn't matter. What YOU want matters. And ALWAYS go after your dreams. I didn't have parents that told me I could do and be whatever I wanted...so I didn't go after my dreams...and I regret that the most out of anything. I'm too scared to hardly do anything now. I'm afraid I'll screw it up. Or that I'll be alone. Don't be me. Do it. Grow. Learn all you can now. Learn two languages. Take care of your body and mind. Who cares about guys right now, or girls, whatever. You will meet the perfect person when the time is right. Just prepare for your future. Trust me. I truly wish I had. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è There are so many things I wish I could do over. But those are the big ones. And if you feel things, tell your parents. Write it down if you have to. Tell your parents they need to talk to you like an adult. You have opinions and thoughts that matter. You're not a child anymore. You need to be treated with respect. And to communicate openly and honestly. And please, for the love of everything, do not do drugs. I spent 11 years in hell because of them. In the beginning it feels like they take away your anxiety and fears...but only for a little while. Then all of that goes away. They take control of your life. And all of your anxiety, depression, everything gets 10Xs worse...and you have to start over ten years later, from the beginning, with nothing. It's a horrible feeling. I have PTSD from my years as an addict. So please don't. Even if your friends do. You don't have to. Be better. You have so much life left.

It's okay to take a day off now and then, sometimes you just can't take it. But try not to get into the habit of it, it'll only make the anxiety weigh harder.

Try to find things each day that help you get through it. Something to look forward to, or help you push through.

This.   
  
Don't be like me. I missed so much school due to the anxiety/panic attacks, I ended up in homeschool. I had a great teacher, but the experience was hard. You have to manage every aspect of your curriculum.   
  
Sure, the first few months are nice. Then you start feeling so lonely. You end up delayed. I missed out on so much, I'm basically starting from scratch, learning what I should've learned then. Plus, I missed all the cool field trips I enjoyed as a kid D:  
  
Trust me. The anxiety from going is less intense than the anxiety that comes from not going. Once your brain gives you an easy out, the anxiety of 'going' becomes more and more intense. Pretty soon, you can't go anymore.  
  
I say you should go. If you have to skip a day or two, fine. Maybe tell them that it's really affecting you on a psychological level and that you need an extra day to get pumped up. But don't miss out on your life because of the anxiety, OP. I wish I'd been able to go ü•∫

I tried going for 3 months during my freshman year, but by then, the delays and the subsequent bullying were so extreme I was pushed back into homeschool (home hospice technically).

All you really need is community I think. Mine is my family. Cousins. Siblings. Sometimes coworkers. Etc. not everyone is this lucky to have family which I know also, that means we gotta get creative.

Originally I planned to study in another country where people and working environment are much more friendly. With a sponsor withdrawing sponsorship in the last minute despite of serious promise. 
I struggle a lot with social anxiety where my relatives always give so many condescending comments like you should do xxx industries with diverse views. What bother me is that they never treat me sincerely. Those advice they would never give to their own children. So I cut off their connection. 
I am looking for a job, yet being so anxious about people judgment of the 3 years gap. Overall my vibe is pessimistic while interviewers like the cheerful candidates.

2023-01-21 19:13:09,reddit_comment,"I'd say try to find any job in which you can use to help work on yourself. Going to another country can just make things harder, and the people that judge are all over the world. There isn't such a country that exists that guarantees a better working environment or better coworkers. It is all based on how you are. If you are pessimistic now, why would that change elsewhere? 

I'd look into therapy as a support and try to find a job. Take the advice from people that you want to and ignore the rest. Focus on you. Try not to dwell on other people because I can practically guarantee they are only focused on themselves. 

If you struggle to find work, I would suggest looking at other related fields. Try to be the employee they want. I can tell you that it won't matter what country you find job openings in, no one will want to hire someone who is pessimistic and SHOWS THAT during an interview. Think from their perspective, they have to invest money in you. Would they choose the person who is actively trying to be what they want, or will they choose the pessimistic guy who appears down and appears to hate life? That kind of thing gives employers an idea of the type of work you would do and if you can't put effort into an interview they know the work done will also lack.

I am not wanting to talk down on you. But I do want to see you succeed and I am just giving my view on this. To succeed you have to try to put effort in and be uncomfortable if even a little. 

I know this because this was me. I hated every job, but once you find one that you kinda like, put effort into it. Show the employer you care even if it makes you uncomfortable. I used to be super socially anxious, now I can hold decent conversations. Not to say everyday is perfect, it's not. And I still have SA at times. But exposure to various situations will help albeit difficult.

2021-12-12 08:38:18,reddit_comment,"Hey champ, this is coming from a guy that has been diagnosed with social anxiety at a young age and missed his univeristy graduation, picking up his degree from the office.

Congrats on graduating! Years of studi\\ying, assignments and exams have paid off. That's is what is to be acknowledged before anything else. The discipline, hard work, and perseverance to get the degree/diploma means more than any event attached to it.  

The events are footnotes in your life. You sit near other people waiting for your name to be called you get your paper and photos taken, talk with any family/friends/teachers, and that's that. Life goes on.

If missing a graduation feels like a big deal, then you may have to ask yourself why? Will people judge me by not showing? Why do I feel uncomfortable seeing people? Will missing out on my graduation affect my self-worth. Does having my name called up to be on stage in front of hundreds/thousands make me anxious?

Being nervous before a big event is normal. This coming from a guy who has SA and has won public speaking competitions and announced sporting events in front of thousands. I have to pep talk my self everytime I do something, and even when people say I do a good job, I still doubt myself. But the thing that gets me through is the following: I want to show the world that a guy labelled with SAD is able to do the things he has been told would be difficult to do, and maybe inspire a person in the process. 

Despite , my view on graduation events as trivial, I do believe that attend social environments as much as possible when you have SAD is one of the best ways to be more confident. I'm not gonna lie to and say that it's easy (I have days where I can talk to anybody, and I have days where asking for directions feels like climbing a mountain). But formulating a genuine reason for YOU as to why you want to push yourself to engage in social situations will serve you very well in your endeavours. You have one life. Live well. be True.

My parents have a rule that I am not aloud to have a phone until im 18 but im not feeling the benifits of not being glued to a phone, I only feel more isolated.  A couple of years ago this wouldnt have been a problem since there were at least more people like me but nowadays it seems impossible to make any friends.  also I am homeschooled which adds on more to the loneliness.  I try to get my mom to get me to do more social things but its really hard.  The main to things I feel that are missing without a phone are my lack of being available and the second thing is, I feel jelous when people are on their phone texting or playing games, the fomo really gets to me, so does not going to public school, but I know for that there are pros and cons.  can anyone give me advice on what to do.  also im not aloud to have any social media or video games on my computer.  I still do browser games tho and [chess.com](https://chess.com).  and pinterest if you could even call that social media.  Also I have fortnite bc I couldnt stand the fortnite suppression any longer.  she uninstalls it and i just install it rigt back.

I have some social anxiety but I try to do my best around people.  I think not having a phone hasnt benifited me socially and has only made my social anxiety worse.

I understand why they are so controlling, but this isnt the same age they grew up in and its near impossible to make friends without a phone.

These two people are toxic and haters of *everything*. Being a senior, there‚Äôs a lot of events going on soon like prom, for example. But they won‚Äôt go to any of them because they constantly act like this stuff is all stupid and for people who ‚Äúpeak in high school‚Äù. 

Truthfully, I don‚Äôt place much value on these events myself. But I would like to go just for the memories and to not feel left out because one thing about me is I always have major FOMO. 

Of course, I have no one to go with because I 1) have major social anxiety and 2) neither of my friends will go (even though I‚Äôve asked them multiple times to go with me ‚Äî which is a whole separate conversation because I‚Äôm sad that they won‚Äôt just go with me for *me* because they know I wish I had people to go with.)

Anyway. This year I‚Äôve made ‚Äúschool friends‚Äù with a group of girls I really like being around. I‚Äôve only done 2 things outside of school with them (by myself, my 2 ‚Äúfriends‚Äù were uninvolved) since getting closer in January, and each time I had a blast. The only thing is, they are in a pre-existing friend group. Which means when they make plans, I‚Äôm excluded because they‚Äôre already a group. At one of these things I did with them we were talking and they even said something along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry we‚Äôre talking about this around you (my name), you‚Äôre probably so confused‚Äù when speaking about some drama they had with a former friend. And they‚Äôre right, I was so confused. But I didn‚Äôt care because I had *friends* that I liked. Those words though just cemented the fact to me that I am in fact and outsider to them. But I don‚Äôt want to be. 

Can anyone offer me advice on how to join their friend group and leave my own? It‚Äôs hard and to make matters worse my social anxiety doesn‚Äôt even allow me to confront then and tell them straight up what‚Äôs going on. Also, kind of a side question, but what do I even do about prom? How do I get invited to their prom group? If I don‚Äôt go with them there‚Äôs no way I can go at all (unless I go alone ‚Äî which I can‚Äôt do: social anxiety!)

To make it worse, I have been dealing with bad depression recently, which is only perpetuated by my social anxiety. Does anyone relate or have advice?",rockstardelena,6

Expectations are high that for some reason because it's the end of the year some magical experience is just going to materialise.

In reality, prices are over-inflated, everywhere is too crowded, so just getting a drink is a mission, everyone is trying too hard to have fun because they think they should be - creating a forced atmosphere, and, if you live in the UK, punch ups usually start kicking off around 9.00.

Whole experience is awful for most people who attempt to go out and celebrate in any British town or city, unless you enjoy vomiting and fighting.

2022-12-17 07:45:04,reddit_post,"Eating alone at a restaurant (My posts are usually one giant paragraph so don‚Äôt count me out if it seems overwhelming lol)

So a few days ago my therapist and I were trying to figure out ways that I could get out and put myself in situations where I might meet new people and she brought up going to a restaurant alone. Now as someone with social anxiety, that sounds terrifying. But I‚Äôve given it some thought and I kinda like the idea. Lately I‚Äôve been doing small things to overcome anxiety, for example, giving the wrong name to the lady at the cash register at a restaurant, calling someone the wrong name just to get their reaction, knocking a bag of chips off the shelf at a grocery store, etc. and it‚Äôs scary at first but once I do it I feel a little more confident than I did before. And so the going to a restaurant alone idea has given me some motivation to accomplish another situation that causes anxiety. The only thing is, is that this would be very anxiety inducing for me. The social anxiety in me would constantly think that people are watching and judging me. And I know that people probably wouldn‚Äôt actually be judging me and so what if they were but I‚Äôm just hesitant. I‚Äôm not sure if anyone else has done this before but if you have did you meet people there and or make any friends? Because that‚Äôs my main reason for wanting to do it. I‚Äôll just be honest I get extremely lonely on the weekends and experience FOMO and I feel like I desperately need to get out and make friends because I‚Äôm quite depressed. I just don‚Äôt want to be told that I shouldn‚Äôt do it if I‚Äôm desperate because I NEED social interaction, like it kills me to be lonely constantly. My therapist says that social interaction is right up there with survival needs like food and water and honestly I can see why. So if anyone would be willing to give me some advice I‚Äôd appreciate it, thanks!",Rbowman023,2

However because of some issues I started the job late meaning everyone got to know each other and bonded so when I joined everyone and already befriended and clicked up.

Before I graduated school a year ago I was doing a bit better with my SA, I was talking to people regularly, I was in clubs, I was staying in touch with my friends, and despite feeling all the regular symptoms I didn't feel as awkward as I usually do. But in the last year I've fallen into a bit of a depression and I feel like I've reverted back on all the progress I made. 

The biggest issue is that I have right now is that I keep overthinking every little action my friends are doing and thinking that they hate me, find me annoying, are only talking to me out of obligation, etc. I feel fomo and jealous when I see them hang out with other people regularly and I had a panic attack the one time I did hang out and I avoid their memes or messages more frequently. I feel embarrassed and uncomfortable when they ask me about my life and I avoid the question. They are good people but I feel them drifting away. 

I guess what I'm asking is has anyone else gone through this? Any recommendations on what to do so that I don't end up losing my friends? I'm in the process of looking for therapy but any other advice? Please and thank you.",_cryptic_cactus_,3

I've seen so many Instagram gram and Snapchat videos of people having fun at the club but ive never got to experience it so I'm experiencing FOMO massively since I'm 23 years old. 

I have never been to a night club before mainly because none of my friends were interested in going . I have a vary small circle of friends and they are mainly introverts and wouldn't want to do this . 

I'm low-key am afraid of people looking at me from a distance and thinking ""Dang, he looks like a loner"".

One of my good friends invited me to her birthday weekend, along with her entire friend group that I hadn't met until I got to her house. She knows I have anxiety when it comes to meeting new people, but she told me her friends were very welcoming and inviting, so I was feeling a little bit better about it until things started.

I kept telling myself not to worry and that it's in my head, but nearly every time I tried to engage in a conversation, they'd respond with a one or two-word sentence, and then go back to talking amongst themselves. At dinner I ended up eating quietly while everyone around me had conversations. We went to the grocery store and everyone was linked up and I ended up walking alone behind them. I was included when we played card games, which made me feel a little better, but when we were getting ready to go to a club, everyone was fixated on each other, wanting me to take pictures of them and their 'squad' after they took the two or three full group photos with me. When we were in the club they had formed their own circle while we were dancing to music to the point where some of the girls pulled me back into the group a few times (which I definitely did appreciate).

I ended up leaving a day early because I was so bummed out that this weekend ended up being something I didn't want it to be. I know I did myself a disservice by doing this, but I can't remember the last time I felt so small and insignificant. I wanted to cry pretty much the entire time I was there. As much as I work on my social anxiety and try to be fun and someone people enjoy being around, I always feel like I end up screwing myself over and making it worse.

2022-01-08 16:19:18,reddit_post,"Is it normal to have no hometown friends as a college student(F/21) from those you had in high school? I‚Äôm a junior in college right now but whenever there are long breaks, I feel this heavy burden of having no friends back home to go back to. Do not mistake this burden as an indicator of extroverted desire. I think I feel this burden mostly because I always see peers on social media hanging out with hometown friends, or I hear them talk about their many close hometown friends. When I go back to my hometown, it is just my family. The only friend I kept talking to after high school moved with her entire family elsewhere. The few other high school friendships I had were quickly self-sabotaged after graduation due to my lack of social motivation/initiation/extroversion. I regret not cherishing any friendships I had prior to college more, but once I got to college, I became socially overwhelmed. On the one hand, I get much energy from being alone (and conversely find most socializing exhausting). But on the other hand, I feel lonely and sad about this current situation and I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs just FOMO or what. I‚Äôm scared to reach out to anyone from my hometown that I talked to in high school, but I wish by some miracle that they could just reach out to me randomly.

I‚Äôm currently not going to school so I‚Äôve also not made new ones. And there are times where I wish I had friends to hang out with. To not go from work and then back home. To have something else that I could do with someone. 

I can‚Äôt really give you any advice, because a lot of the time I don‚Äôt mind having no friends. But there are also times where I feel lonely.

I then decided to take a peek on my Facebook feed page, and my anxiety started to kick in.

Not much has changed, as I scroll down, seeing people living the life. This made me jealous but also my self esteem fell through the window.

In addition, there were also people posting controversial topics that are not afraid to share. Let‚Äôs just I grew up in a rural area. 

These contents led me to deactivate my account in the first place and again today. I regretted on using my Facebook account. I had to clear my mind and stop comparing people‚Äôs lives with mine. There was a time my FOMO moment brought me to a bottom low.

Facebook, as well as other social media like Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat, have become a toxic environment for me and I avoided them for a long time.

2021-09-03 09:29:23,reddit_post,"I'm finally living on my college campus, but I'm a Sophomore, and it's so hard to make friends despite my best efforts. In high school, I had a friend group that I knew since intermediate school, and when you see the same people every day, it's so much easier to get comfortable around them. When covid hit I still talked to my friends, but we all grew farther apart as I took quarantine as an excuse to isolate completely. I had a girlfriend at the time too who knew me since I was two years old, so I was so comfortable with her at that point that it was easy to be myself around her. 

Now I'm in college after spending my first year online. I go to a very big school, so big that it gets really overwhelming as I see so many people hanging out as friends and I walk around just getting FOMO and anxiety that I'll be spending all my nights alone. I know colleges always have events to meet people, and I push myself to go to them. I just can't remember how to talk to people anymore, and I never wanna seem desperate to make friends, so I often dismiss quick introductory small talk and immediately regret it. Any interaction I do have is so awkward, and I often just straight up leave if I start to get a shortness of breath and my mouth gets so dry it's embarrassing. I've come close to tears so many times when I'm alone in my room or something, and I don't have anyone to talk to, as my parents take me not enjoying myself as being ungrateful for the education they're paying for. 

I just really want to meet some people who understand me and are kind enough to accept why I am the way I am. But it's getting to the point where I'm so afraid to go outside because the anxiety stomach ache will become too much and I'll panic. I'd love to go out and do things, I'm not a big partier, and I hate the whole ""party dude,"" and ""do it for the boys"" kind of mentality among other guys my age, but I still like to have fun in other ways. I'm a musician, and really want to meet other musicians to maybe form a band, it's one of those things I'm obsessive about and talk too much about to the point where I seem like a robot to other people.

2021-10-12 13:10:34,reddit_post,"I want to not be me... I (18M) always had quite a severe case of social anxiety, and to be honest I don't think I even remember a single day in my life during which I didn't have it. Nowadays, its really getting on my nerves. Throughout all of these years, I always feel like I've lived life as an outsider, as a spectator, as if I'm not really part of it. I do believe that I can change myself, that I can become anything I want to be, if only I get the opportunity to ""get a feel"" for it at least once. But here's the problem; I don't have the slightest of ideas what it feels like to be ""normal"".

 I've had a lot of difficulty making friends throughout elementary and secondary, and now I'm in college and its not exactly better.  Sure, I can manage to make the initial steps, find a few other awkward people, and get to know them, so I've mostly been able to find somewhere to sit during lunch hours, but I've never been able to really ""befriend"" them, and I often get the feeling that as soon as they find their own friend group, they slowly forget about me. Sure, I'm not the most interesting, but I think its mostly due to me being extremely reluctant to let them close to me. Most of the time, I would decline the rare invitations that come my way, although they were extremely rare. And so, I've managed to survive the entirety of elementary and secondary (middle and high school in the US I think) without ever hanging out with anyone outside of school, and never had a sleepover, or anything. During summers, I stayed home and pretty much did nothing.

As so, it comes as no surprise that the lockdown felt... completely natural, as if it was something I had been doing every summer for the last 15 years or so. The pandemic lockdown, in a way, was much needed... After so many years of trying to survive in a classroom full of people, I needed a year and a half alone in my house. However, it did bring its own set of problems, namely me pretty much burning all the bridges I still had with my school friends by failing to maintain them, and self-reflection, which made me realized just how lonely I feel, and also made me doubt a few core aspects of myself that I thought were immutable.

I've come to the realization that the path I've chosen up to this point in life might mostly be due to social anxiety. I always tried my best at school, because that was the only thing I had left. I sucked at sports because I was never really good, and playing with other kids stressed me out so much as a kid that I just didn't do it. I don't have any secret talents, and I don't have any social life either. I never had much access to video games growing up, so the only thing I could do was scrolling through Youtube, Reddit, and studying. I had decent grades, but I wasn't a ""good student"". If anything, I have the worst work ethics in the world and I hate pretty much every single subject. But if I gave up on that front, what would I be? Nothing. To put it bluntly, even if I wanted to be a ""delinquant"" (does this word exist in english?), I wouldn't have the guts to do it due to anxiety. School was the easy path.

In a way, the pandemic gave me the time to think about all the things I've missed out on, and I'm now feeling a sort of sudden onset of FOMO or something, as if I've suddenly noticed all the things  I could've done, but didn't do, because I was me. I feel a sudden urge to go out and ""experience"" life fully, and do everything there is to be done.... Wild parties ,crazy raves, hanging out with friends, everything from the tamest to the wildest, and I don't even care about the consequences anymore... If I had to choose between a short-lived but wild life, or to continue on my path to inevitable lifelong shut-in, I would love to choose the former. But I can't, due to social anxiety and also not having friends (how do you even go out? how do you go to concerts, parties, how does it work? I need someone to show me, to introduce me to the scene, how do you build lasting friendships from scratch?), and I'm still stuck on this path that I've been on for 18 years, except now its also slowly but surely falling apart.

I don't know what'll happen in the future. However, I do hope that its not going to be how I predict it to be, and some nights, I feel like if that's what I have to look forward to, then I might as well end everything now. 

I'd give everything so that tomorrow, when I'll wake up, I'll realize this was all a huge nightmare, that I am actually a normal, fully-functioning human, and not some broken thing that slipped through quality control. Or maybe there'll be a pill that will change me as a whole, make me a normal human, I don't even care anymore if I'm not myself, if anything, that'll be perfect. I've had enough of being me.

Why did I even write all of that? I have no idea. Feels good to get it out I guess.",yeetaway19942003,4

I am about 6 months into my program and with the masks and not being able to be together in the classroom the first few months I found it difficult to make strong connections with my peers other than my one friend and feel stuck in a position where people think I'm quiet and avoidant but I really just want to talk to them and make a connection but I don't know what to say or how and don't want to come across as desperate. I know that I have made a lot of progress throughout the years in being more comfortable around people but am feeling myself revert more back to old bad habits (going to sit alone with headphones, not answering questions or speaking up in class or groups, and having trouble with eye contact and authority, procrastinating making appointments). Along with the stress of grad school, this worsening social anxiety has led to me having difficulty concentrating and I am finally looking to go to therapy to work through it since I feel like I have done as much as I can on my own and need some support. I feel like my social anxiety has led me to feel a lot of FOMO and missed out opportunities and I am sick of it impacting my ability to make lasting connections with people.

We are all in our late 20's and to be honest most of the time it feels like college. I like it a lot because I've never felt that ""I belong here"" feeling before and I do at work.

I've been beating myself up with negative thoughts, here they are:

- When I arrived at work I was pretty insecure. Scared of mistakes. No confidence and no selfsteem. People obviously perceived me that way and now, a year later,  that I'm in a better place mentally, I think I got that stigma stuck to me now and it bothers me.

- I'm weird. Awkward.  People laugh when I'm being serious because they think I'm joking. I sometimes say weird stuff. They say im the ""good kind of crazy"" and funny... this has happened through my whole life, i don't know if that's a bad thing. 

- Sometimes I feel like no one likes me and that they think I suck at work secretly 

- My brain is 100% sure they talk trash about me behind my back

- I admit sometimes I do say bad things about other people  or maybe I complain. When others do this, for me it's understandable, when I do it, I feel toxic, that I'm a bad person, that I'm a black cloud, etc. (I'll try not to say one bad thing about anyone anymore)

- I have FOMO, even when I don't even want to go.

Also if you feel stuck in one social role or dynamic with your coworkers - being the weird one or whatever- maybe jostle things and shake it up by changing something big? Big enough to shake their perception of you, and your perception of you, giving you some space to redefine yourself and your role there.

I spent my childhood past 12 or so on video games and hardly ever socialising. At the time I didn't care or think I was missing anything so I carried on but my social skills and confidence got worse and worse.

Then I got to college and that just flew by and I didn't make any friends. As this went on I became more and more aware of my SA. I'm so angry with myself for wasting the chance, I did gain enough confidence to ask a girl out which was huge but my confidence still stayed the same besides with one person. 

Now I'm in Uni second year and uni's supposed to be this great place you meet loads of like-minded friends and go party and do fun things. But I've only got two or three people I know a little and I never went out besides a handful of gigs. I'm not one for partying and getting drunk but I still feel like I'm missing something, this isn't what it's hyped to be. But then it wouldn't if I'm locked in my room again. I don't know it it's FOMO or I just haven't found my confidence and my people, but if I'm going to find it this needs to be the time or I've wasted it all.

I'm 18 and am going to start my second year of college soon. I'm also the same as you, in the way that I feel like I'm wasting my teenage years. This is supposed to be the time of my life, but instead, I'm spending it all inside on my computer because my social anxiety controls my life and I'm too nervous to talk to other people. I also have FOMO but I don't go to any parties or big events.

2019-08-03 18:10:40,reddit_comment,"Hey there.   

 I see so much of me in your story. Ive also spent my best years in video games. Ive confessed to the girl i liked. Ive secluded myself during teen years and past and didnt make any new friends. I was wondering if its my way and im just not interested in typical things, or im missing out the way you do. Difference is i had the guts to acknowledge my SA at much later state, which made me miss out much more, regret much more.    

   From my experience i can tell you there are two very unproductive patterns of thinking, regretting the past and what you missed out and placing unrealistic expectations regarding what your life should look like, what the uni should be in your case. Locking in the past and regretting it obviously doesnt give you any good. It cant provide you anything for the future or the present moment. The best you can do is look for the positives you can extract, how can it actually benefit you. Ofc it can be really hard to do that, but there is always a better side. Sometimes i look at my gaming years and i realize i had good moments too, i had some decent memories, i had some interesting interactions. It did establish my personality in a way, it did help me find and understand myself better.   

Unrealistic expectations can also be as harmful. The way you perceive uni, the way people perceive uni isnt realistic, its thought to us by media, by society etc. The way how we want it to be, the way how it would be is something different and something we can set up. Dont place wild parties as a requirement to have fun or achieve your dream state, maybe indeed its not your thing.    

Dont rush yourself, dont blame yourself, dont enforce it upon you that you are missing so much, or that you are wasting precious time. Dont demand things to happen now, in this very moment. This all isnt gonna help you. You've already figured out whats wrong and you have the motivation to change it. Focus and start working toward it, dont let that background weight hamper you.",sylsocial,2

2021-03-17 19:50:10,reddit_post,"Alcohol Intolerance ruins my social life I‚Äôm a 20 yr old east asian girl with asian flush/alcohol intolerance, and it gives me lots of anxiety to be around alcohol. It infiltrates my social life, so much so that it ended a relationship with a guy that I thought I had potential with. 

Alcohol intolerance and bad experiences with peer pressure (contantly being asked why i‚Äôm the only one not drinking) inflicts lots of anxiety on me. I just want to be like everyone else and brend in. Since I experience bad side effects such as asthma, hives, itchyness, redness, headache, and nausea, I feel very left out, especially from a college/adult crowd of my own age. I‚Äôll clarify I‚Äôm not socially awkward or shy, and can have fun without alcohol, but I just cant handle the peer pressure and feeling embarrassed anymore.

I cant drink more than a beer to start feeling very phsically uncomfortable. My boyfriend has no problems drinking just like any average guy, and so do his friends. I live with him, and his friends come over once a week to drink a lot. I am dreading the weekends now. I feel intimidated when I‚Äôm always offered to drink, even when I understand people are just trying to be good friends. The main thing is that I feel lots of anxiety just being around alcoholic drinks now, and I wish I could get drunk with them (I have never felt anything pleasant from alcohol before). We‚Äôre now breaking up because I cant stand the anxiety, and if I can‚Äôt get along with his friends, he says he doesn‚Äôt want to be with me. So I‚Äôm moving back home. It‚Äôs such a shame because we have such a nice relationship besides this problem. 

I feel left out, anxious, nervous, and FOMO around social situations w alcoholic drinks. I‚Äôm seeking for some people who share the same asian flush genetics with me, and if it has ruined their social life as much as mine have. Or, if you have asian flush, how do you make it feel better besides pepcid? It doesnt work on me.

2020-09-12 12:27:27,reddit_post,"Discord Anxiety Hey all. I've had some stuff I've been mulling over for the past few months since quarantine and I realize it's not getting any better. This post is half word vomit/me trying to get things off of my chest but also any advice/suggestions on how to stop stressing over everything would be nice as well!

Since quarantine hit, I haven't been able to socialize as much irl so in lieu of all that, I decided to join Discord to meet ppl in similar fandoms.

I joined some Discord servers and encountered a common roadblock: feeling like you're killing the conversation/getting ignored in favour of people that have been there longer/part of the ""clique"". Felt awful, but I kept trying because I thought it might get better.

After a while, I finally found some Discords that I was doing pretty well in, but as soon as new people joined they were able to ease into or start conversation so much easier than I was and they'd become a staple of the group from that point on. That, or they were invited by others they already knew from Twitter and everyone would be excited to see them. I end up clamming up because I feel out of place. Whenever this happens on a server I actually feel comfortable in, I end up feeling super dejected and decide to take a break from the server, only to think that in the time I'm away, more people are joining and fitting in and by the time I re-join, it'll be too late. Basically I suffer from massive FOMO.

Also I find with online chats I tend to overanalyze everything that's being said. If I'm ignored, why? Or sometimes I'll join in on a convo and I'll say something and the person after me will say the same thing, but everyone will respond to that person instead. It feels like I'm making 0 contribution to the convo, and I end up feeling silly. Then I wonder if others are reading the convo going ""oh look at that person getting ignored/trying so hard to fit in, poor them"".

There's also a server that I'm quite active in, and it was a lot more active when I first joined, but now the only other people that talk in the server are the two mods who are good friends. So sometimes when we talk, they'll reference inside jokes and I'll just feel out of place and I'm wondering if I should comment at all? At the same time they are responsive to the things I say, but it's become apparent to me that while I'm good at starting conversations, I suck at continuing them. I started posting less because I wonder if they think I'm boring, and if they wished if another member was active instead of me.

Anyway, whenever I think about the above it just kills my mood for the day. It's nice having people to talk to about the fandoms you're in, but I never felt this type of dejection before I made a discord so idk. Doesn't help that I feel that I'm being left on read in my irl group chats as well. I know that this will all probably pass once I obtain a full-time job and my mind will have more important things to focus on, but rn I'm just stuck in this mindset of mine.",rexall05,10
2020-09-14 03:44:58,reddit_comment,"Yess I can relate to everything you said. It doesn't help if the mods or older members have inside jokes and that's all they talk about in the general chats. I've seen so many servers with like hundreds of members but only a handful of people are ever active. Like if there's a friends circle already established, why bother seeking and adding new members? And to add to that all the mods and current members ever do when you join is say ""welcome"" and then ignore you and continue with their conversation. Bottom line is all these ""friend-making"" discord servers are not great for people with SA.",fj_45,2
2020-09-15 09:30:13,reddit_comment,"Right? It's always a select few that are active even though there are hundreds of members. I can't help but wonder if the non-active members had the same experience as me and just stopped talking (but never bothered leaving the server), or if they just don't care at all. Cause if it's the latter then god I wish I could be like that.

And yes! They'll say ""Welcome"" and ask you a few questions but you get drowned out by the convo already going on, or an active member logs in suddenly and changes the topic and they'll just forget you're there. 

I was hoping using Discord for exposure therapy would help with my SA but idk, I guess you're right :( But thanks a lot for replying to my post - really happy to know that I'm not alone in feeling like this :)",rexall05,3

The more I developed this skill, the more I realized that the underlying thoughts causing social anxiety were irrational.

2020-09-01 23:17:17,reddit_post,"I hate my former highschool class groupchat. It gives me immobilizing waves of anxiety. (Details in text) I've recently graduated, but in senior year I was in a special class that was an old tradition in my school where you apply for a limited amount of spots and go through the year learning about humanities and building up a friendship with 35 other seniors. 

It was partially the point, but I was friends with literally one other person who was accepted. I knew the others , but one could tell I was kind of the ""weird one"" out of the 35 and many were nice to me , but more because they were polite and nice people. 

Throughout the senior  year and now , we have a group chat on snapchat. I hate it for many reasons.

 For one , most of the participants have this easy banter and  relationship with the others, where you can tell that this is a group of friends. If I can muster the will to send something , it has always come out as only of formal reasons or just aloof.

For another, it always feels that in person or in the group chat (if you know the people it's easier to tell in the chat) that I'm being talked too almost as if I'm a child. Like were all pretending something so I can technically be included and then the conversation moves on.

I dont know why it hurts so much for nice people trying to be nice , and I don't know why it feels like these nice people are talking to me like a  child but it does , so especially now that the groupchat is getting more use, every time I see that ghost , my chest tightens up , my limbs get weak, and my vision blurs for a passing moment.

I'm socially awkward in person , I happen to have high functioning autism, but it's never as bad as that groupchat.

2021-01-15 06:02:49,reddit_post,"Social anxiety from not wanting to socialize or the opposite? I might have come to a realization that my aversion to socializing / any anxiety I might get comes from not wanting to socialize in the first place.

However I DO like socializing when I am excited for the event or if it‚Äôs with people I love. 

I‚Äôve always thought my social anxiety prevents me from wanting to socialize.

2019-09-17 18:44:09,reddit_post,"Is there any way to have a healthy relationship with social media when you have social anxiety? I deleted Facebook and Snapchat about a year ago in the attempt to become more mentally healthy and I had previously deleted Instagram in 2016. Social media was exacerbating feelings of anxiety, loneliness, depression and FOMO (fear of missing out), and I'd had enough.

However, as time has gone on, I've found myself now struggling with feelings of being disconnected and I don't feel as 'involved' as what I once was. I've missed out on lots of stuff (some things I'm glad I've missed out on) and I'm trying to push past my social anxiety by becoming more involved in different things, but I feel as though I can't be fully involved without at least Facebook as this is where many groups and events are posted. So, I've been flirting with the idea of making a new Facebook account (my 3rd one in the past few years due to my accounts getting too 'overwhelming' with too many 'friends').

I was wondering if and how one can have a healthy relationship with Facebook when dealing with social anxiety? I'm getting anxious right now at the thought of people who I don't really care about adding me and me feeling pressured to accept them because it's the 'nice' thing to do, but I also want to keep my Facebook private. I get worked up when someone adds a friend of mine on Facebook, but not me - despite us knowing each other. I get so triggered so easily. I wish I could disable the 'add friend' button, it would make my life SO much easier. I just want a simple life, and I feel like Facebook complicates things for me in ways that people don't understand. I have no desire to be online friends with people who I don't give a crap about in real life, but I feel like that is inevitable and I may have to compromise. Does anyone have any advice?

**TLDR:** *I've been off social media for a while and I've mostly enjoyed the many benefits... but I'm now battling with feelings of being 'left out', lonely and disconnected.

I have even gone to parties uninvited (while intoxicated) to try and feel like I was a part of something.  Looking back I cringe because I am really shy in school and wasn‚Äôt really friends with  people at the parties but just pretended like I was meant to be there.

I often find myself replaying people‚Äôs stories to try and relive that moment. I did eventually hide Snapchat and turn off notifications and that did help me but I enabled it again.",betterself1,4

2018-09-06 02:30:07,reddit_post,"Instagram and life. I finally joined Instagram because of FOMO, fully knowing it would trigger my anxiety. On one hand, I love seeing the beauty of this world through pics. On the other, I'd be lying if I said I don't get jealous seeing everyone's pics. I know the whole ""highlight reel"" theory, but still.

One thing that really ramps up my anxiety is comparing how many likes and friends/followers I have to people I know. They have a more active Instagram with more likes and followers and that makes me feel down because I like to think I'm a likeable person... But it doesn't show.

Also, I see friendships formed between former and current coworkers that make me feel insanely left out. We get along great at work, but we don't hang out outside of work... But they do.

I wonder if people can really smell desperation and anxiety. I try my hardest not to give off those vibes but maybe they're too strong to hide.

I get so depressed about my life sometimes because I'm always comparing myself to others and Instagram is the perfect platform to do so. 

I'm 30, married with a great husband, have a good career and goals to move forward, but I always feel sorely lacking in the social life and hobbies department. I've tried to read self help books but never finished them... I've gone to one Meetup years  ago but haven't been back because I'm scared and I don't want the people I  know now to judge me for meeting friends through there. I'm very over analytical and critical. I don't know where to start. I feel lost and confused.

I go to therapy but it's barely helped. This is so depressing.

TL;DR: Instagram depresses me. I feel worthless when comparing myself to others. I don't have hobbies and don't have the social life I want. How do I get out of this?",anonymousstraggler,10

‚ÄúEveryone MUST see a total solar eclipse once‚Äù

‚ÄúThe difference between a 99% eclipse and totality is unfathomable‚Äù

Not bothered by any of the conspiracy theories about the eclipse but I am finding myself increasingly anxious about the logistics of the solar eclipse tomorrow. I live in one of the few places in the track that will be clear-skied and everyone has been warning us about a massive influx of tourists. Where I live will be at about 98% totality so I‚Äôm traveling around an hour to get to 100%, but we live in a really rural area and the infrastructure is awful. I‚Äôm terrified we‚Äôll get stuck in traffic and miss totality, or that we‚Äôll get in a car accident, or that some tourists will jam up the road and we‚Äôll miss it. It‚Äôs stupid, I know, it‚Äôll be fun to go see it but it‚Äôs not ACTUALLY a big deal if I don‚Äôt make it to totality. But the rhetoric from the news and internet and everywhere that‚Äôs saying ‚Äúyou HAVE to see this‚Äù and ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt want to miss this once in a lifetime chance‚Äù has built up this weird angst in my brain.

Any thought that starts that way is an anxiety thought. You don't need to explore it. 

Why? Because the answer is that if you are in traffic and miss it? It will suck. 

When you imagine that scenario you get the same feeling as if it would happen. But it hasn't. If you are an anxious person and go through every what if scenario you will feel bad as if having experienced all those. 

Then none of them happen. But you wasted all that energy and emotion on these thoughts that never happened. 

You just have to live it. You can't waste time on what ifs you can't control or do anything about. Just take precautions like arriving early. 

It'll be awesome trust me!! They've made such a big deal about traffic it'll probably discourage people and mean its less crowded. 

And then you'll see the eclipse!",Kaiisim,3

Remember, the experience is meant to be enjoyable, and it's okay if you don't make it to totality. Your well-being is what matters most.

2024-06-19 11:49:55,reddit_post,"FOMO & Living Abroad I‚Äôve recently been given my work permit as an auxiliary language assistant in Spain. Though it is exciting and new, I am absolutely terrified. I (26F) have never lived away from home, even during college, so searching for housing and living with roommates will be a completely different territory for me.
During this time, my best friend is also planning her wedding, of which I will be a bridesmaid of. This is an event her and I have dreamed about since we were little, and the possibility of me missing out on any part of the process terrifies me as I know her other friends will be able to be more hands on than I will be able to while abroad and with a time difference, amongst other things. I‚Äôm going with $9K+ in my savings as a safety net, but realistically I do not want to dig too deep into it while away, so finances are also a concern. 
I have acted as a quasi caretaker for my alcoholic father for years, so this trip will also allow me to practice distance and force him to have no choice but to not depend on me as I won‚Äôt be close by. I very much live my life for others, both of the therapists I have had have told me they see and hear this when I explain why I do or don‚Äôt do things. I don‚Äôt take risks for myself because I fear upsetting those who mean the most to me, as I see value in myself based on if I feel valued by others; if I offer something to someone even if that means tearing away at myself and my wants/needs. 
I think to myself that being an aux can wait, that now is not a time to just up and leave, but my friend (who is getting married) stated there will always be something going on that will make you feel you must stay, but that this trip is to finally do something for the first time for myself despite anything/anyone else. I‚Äôm stressed thinking she is saying this because she doesn‚Äôt want me having resentment towards her down the road, but a part of me feels it is genuine. I just don‚Äôt know what to decide. I don‚Äôt have many friends in my life, only 2 really. With having so few I try so hard to not ruffle any feathers.
Is it selfish to go abroad? I want to, but I don‚Äôt want to miss out on anything if I can help it.

Recently though, I have seen my friends graduate college, and I will be graduating three years later, I graduated HS late, and spent a lot of time partying. I missed some people's 21st bdays due to being unorganized and now iM having ALOT OF ANXIETY ABOUT LIFE. I feel always so behind, and I feel fomo with evrything , not vising my friends' colleges before they graduated, not being on the same level, not getting As in college as I said I would change but being so perfect is fucking hard, FOMO on partying since I put it on the back shelf, yet I feel like I would be too old for it later. I just keep having the worst thoughts like Imissed the best days of my life because I chose to be an alcoholic early on, drop out, and now I'm behind everyone, and even thought I WILL GRADUATE COLLEGE LATE, IT WILL HAUNT ME. I will still be older than other students around me, and I mostly am (I'm 22 and a freshmen transfer) and I feel like I need to stop partying now to gt my life in order but will regret that as later most people will quit partying get married settle down. It feels no matter how I live life i fuck up and I want to stay true to myself, I want to have fun, I want to still work on my hobbies, which is making films about characters in NYC, or interviwing people on the streets, but I feel like that too will stop me from graduating college soon as it's all distracting and gets me warped into another world, not an academic one. I just keep feeling no matter what I do I will feel behind, maybe in terms of work accomplishments, dating, graduating etc, its all making me want to lock myself in a room and scream everyday as I missed out on all these birthdays and graduations and I didnt even have any of my own cause of my anxiety and comparison syndrome. At the same time Im not sure if graduating with everyone, at the time I predicted and having coorporate work accomplishments would make mehappy. Its like maybe I would want to have my own path and being att the same level with everyone would be boring. I do feel very motivated to be honest, to do well in school now, be on school teams, make fresh friends in the current environment to stop comparing to my highschool friends, etc, BUt the anxiety that I will always be behind in every way no matter what, and will fail at my own personal dreams and will always feel fomo comparing myself to other people's college experiences, work pace, dating, instagrams, partying etc, will always kill me. I used to not have mad anxiety, but being behind, starting at graduating late in highschool, has really made me go crazy. Now I wish I went to another highschool but I cant change that. I wish I partied less, but I cant change that and probably would have the opposite regret, if on another path right now. i wish I cared more about grades, But only can fix that moving forward. However I have made lists about everything i sucked at and failed at, lost, missed opportunities, all the bad grades I got, all the good projects I did do but lost etc, I just keep repeating in a circle without really fixing my atittude and living in the present. I have made a list of 100 regrets, all these birthdays I have missed, all these school things I missed, all the hopes I had wantd to accomplish by 21 I missed. Life is a shocker, and I dont want to keep zoning out in front of my new friends at my new school but I keep thinking 100 what ifs I went to college w my hs friends earlier, what if I had better grades, would I be in community college right now? What if I was more talkative in school before, wht if I didnt party and do this drug, what if I was still friends with this person? What if I am this anxious of a failure the rest of my life? AND then a hand swoops in front of me, asking if Im okay. Im zoning out in my new college as its a new change and I feel so shitty about myself. I will keep going down this path if I dont fix my attitude and before I know it will be graduated late not remembering anything because I was so negative. Plz someone tell me life gets better after a bunch of fucks up in the earlys 20s and that there are ways to minimize this level of anxiety and fomo and comparison. To me the only way to do it would be in talk therapy everyday or live in a cave cuz at this point social media, being in a new school, seeing everyone do better than me, hating myself, and not even enjoying the present sucks so much I cant even breathe sometimes!",yomamaIgotoFITarthoe,2

One anxiety I have that's a bit ""weirder"" to me is that there's so many things I could read, watch, play, or learn, it scares me. Because they all seem amazing, but I have limited time to do it. I mean, we all have to work, and our lives aren't forever, so our free time is limited.

It's like I want to have a bucket list which includes a million books and hobbies. And then I think, shouldn't I prioritize spending time with loved ones? And I still want to be a good friend. 

I wonder if this anxiety is actually a symptom that I don't feel my life right now is fulfilling, and once I figure out what makes me happy and to feel content, this FOMO anxiety will naturally disappear.

2023-03-09 08:09:48,reddit_post,"Always struggled with anxiety and fomo. How do I fix this, especially in a place where it's everywhere? I've always had a bad case of FOMO and also not being ""liked"" if that makes sense. I feel as I am forgotten alot which is why I feel this way. Im in college and it it's everywhere.

Naturally, this contributes to a lot of anxiety. Growing up i was always the odd one out and or forgotten in groups and or talked about. It hurt. But now since I am older in college, it has gotten better but when you grow up with something, it sticks and essentially becomes part of you.

But it's still here nonetheless. I am always stressing out about stuff like my roommates having a secret groupchat behind my back, or not having much friends or them forgetting about me. I can have fun and be with people but I always have to be the one to reach out to do stuff and whatnot (and chances are we end up doing stuff) otherwise no one does and I am alone.. which I guess pick your poison?

I am already stressing about this fall with all the events, parties, socializing, etc... which is literally 6 months out, which is awhile.

I am trying to fix this fomo and anxiety and stop overthinking about things but it is just hard when you grow up experiencing it and continue to do so when you're older. I've grown a lot as a person too but this is a factor will take time to fix. How do I deal with this meanwhile? I also can't just make people remember me and stuff.

2022-11-19 10:43:57,reddit_post,"How can I get over my awful FOMO? FOMO - Fear of missing out. 

When I was younger and my mom went out to social gatherings/parties, I would get this awful anxiety that she would die, that she didn‚Äôt love me because she was leaving me, and that I was missing out on having fun like she was having. It got better as I got older, and she also stopped going to such things and as such I didn‚Äôt have the same chances to worry. She says she doesn‚Äôt like going to such events, I figure half because social gatherings of relative strangers aren‚Äôt her thing, and also because she knew I was worried sick at home. 

Jump forward to today and I‚Äôm in a relationship with the girl I love, and as an unfortunate consequence, I‚Äôve rediscovered my old childhood anxiety. Tonight as I write this, she‚Äôs out at her friend‚Äôs party on the other side of town and I‚Äôve got the same anxiety as I had all those years ago. I worry firstly that I‚Äôm missing out on the fun she‚Äôs having/the fun I would have with her, I‚Äôm worrying about her safety given such parties contain alcohol, and worst of all, I worry just slightly about how much she loves me if she‚Äôs so busy doing other things. The last concern is absolutely unreasonable, unhealthy, and generally awful, and it‚Äôs the part that bothers me the most exactly because it‚Äôs so unhealthy to a relationship. 

I don‚Äôt want to feel this way when she goes out, but the problem is that I don‚Äôt choose to feel this way. I just get the feeling and the thoughts that follow with it. How can I get over this anxiety so I don‚Äôt feel bad when the person I love goes out and lives their life without me for a little while?",Silverwhite2,1

In regards to safety, all you can do is keep your phone with you and within reach in case she needs you. I'm sure that it's no crime to send her a text or something at some point asking her how she's doing, if that makes you feel better, but obviously keep in mind she's busy. Note that she will most probably be fine.

Acknowledge your thoughts on how her going to a party without you must mean she loves you less, as you're doing here, but recognise that this is an unreasonable thought produced by the anxious you. More sensible parts of you know better.

At first, I was very glad and satisfied, because based on their titles, I think those posts could be helpful or inspiring for me.

I just can't focus on the sentences or words I was reading at all because I can't get rid of the idea of reading one of the other 2 posts instead. I just wished that I could read them all simultaneously, but actually I can only read them one by one, one after one.

As I can remember, I've been suffering from this kind of anxiety since when I was in middle school. Each time I was about to study, I would always find it extremely hard to decide which subject  to begin with, maths, physics, chemistry...? It could drive me crazy. I've even developed a defending/escaping mechanism for it. I would look at the floor around the chair I was sitting, from the left to the right, and tell myself that nothing important has been left on the ground, to calm myself down a little bit. If it didnt work well, I would try it several more times, again and again, like some kind of compulsive behavior.

Trick with this is to set goals that are achievable for you. No need in worrying about the fact you have missed the Bitcoin train or that you missed when houses are cheap and you should have jumped on the train, it won't change anything. Stay in the moment and if the opportunity presents itself, take it. 

Many look at Bitcoin as a list opportunity but the reality is that when it started, it was a huge risk. You had the same opportunity to lose your money as double or triple it. If you couldn't lose it then it wasn't an opportunity.

2020-09-08 12:09:17,reddit_post,"How to quit social media without FOMO I imagine a lot of people feel this way lately. I have been doing my best to cut back on social media lately because of how overwhelming it is. I compulsively check my social media constantly throughout the day and it drives me crazy how time consuming it is and how much energy it takes. 

For a little background, I‚Äôve got a few chronic illnesses and haven‚Äôt been able to leave my house because I‚Äôm an at-risk patient. I think part of the exhaustion is seeing family and friends out there acting like the pandemic is no big deal. Its just insanely frustrating to see that. But at the same time, I feel like I need to know what‚Äôs going on in the world. 

I successfully cut out instagram and snapchat. I realized that when I deleted those apps, the people I regularly talked to there didn‚Äôt seek out conversations over text even though I let them know, which kinda sucks. 

So I kept facebook and twitter. I think facebook is the bigger problem because I follow more people I know in real life. Twitter is more for game news and art, though I do get some news on there too.

2021-01-13 17:59:32,reddit_post,"Always feel hasted, FOMO-related Hi,

I have become increasingly aware of the limited time we have in our lives. This concept has given me great anxiety, as I have many hobbies - film, music, books, board games, playing piano and guitar. I have so many lists of films I want to see, books I want to read, etc. The sheer amount of possibilities and choices drives me crazy. I know it's a first world problem, but it's giving me a lot of anxiety. 

I tend to spend hours on chosing the next film/tv-show/book, but rarely ever read/watch one. Always on the lookout for a book that is absolutely worth the time. Fear of missing out (FOMO) is definitely a factor, but I don't know what to do about it. 

Immediately after waking up, my mind considers all the possibilities: ""I can read this book, watch this film, etc."" But when I do so, I keep wondering if there's not a better alternative. I always feel hastened and can never relax.

Can you recommend a book/article or anything other that provides some insight into this?

Thanks.",Superhanc41,1
2020-12-28 12:44:31,reddit_post,"Fomo & beating yourself up - the worst parts of having anxiety ( to me) as told by me We live in a society that is so adamant about inclusive and sensitivity towards others because everyone is different and yet, as preachy as people can get on the internet, the culture online is to treat people like they're fodder or expendable. 

I'm talking about ghosting. It is something that anyone can and often will face at some point if they are active on the internet, but it's such a powerful thing that people don't realize can hurt.

As a person with high anxiety and insecurities I am not the best at brushing off things and I know many people have that issue.  Whether you're dating online or a roleplayer ( like me) or a gamer or a social media influencer, doing these things means taking the risk of failure, rejection, and ghosting so if you don't deal with those well , you shouldn't out yourself out there right? 

But it's not that simple. Some people are just trying to do what they love and what makes them happy, and while you don't exactly owe a stranger anything, it's so messed up to take from them.

When I send out messages and get a ride response or talk a bit and get rejected, there's an obvious sting, but when a conversation is going really well and you're suddenly ghosted/unfriended, the lack of closure that leaves you without and answer as to what you did wrong ( because of course it's your fault, right? - anxiety 2020) can you really just brush it off?

That's when the fomo kicks in..  for me at least. Much like when I screw something up, even if it's a simple mistake, my anxiety takes it and elevates it then replays it over and over until i get upset or obsess over reading into everything to try to find a reason and get that closure , since you can't exactly ask the person.

What was it that I said?
Did they not like what i suggested?
Did someone say something about me?

And then it gets carried way too far until I start beating myself up and putting myself down. The other person goes on and doesn't think about it but here I am, stuck letting them live rent free in my head. It doesn't matter if I did nothing wrong and I know it. It doesn't matter if that just one person who rejected me but I have over 2 dozen who for months have enjoyed my company, I'm going to focus all my energy on this one person and you any stop me, mwahahaha!!!

But that isn't right , is it? And I know that, don't I? Wasn't i the one who went down the rabbit whole of self help and self love to build up some confidence? Wasn't I the one who went on a rant to her friend about learning to grow without closure and not expecting the universe to owe her just because she does nice things? Why can I acknowledge that being cool and aloof is a good practice, but not actually do it?

Oh, right. Because I care. 

I care too much. I give too much of myself. I am a social butterfly in a cocoon of social anxiety and yet, if I talk to you for a few moments and we bond over anything, I'm going to care about you. Why? I'm not sure, could be a number of reasons. All I know is that I am going to see you not as a name on a screen that I can toy with and block, but as a person, a living, breathing person somewhere in he works sitting on a device just... searching. You could have a great life, you could have a terrible one, but whatever it is z you're searching for something just like me.

So I'm going to care about you and I'm going to ask you how your day was and be worries and check in if you tell me you're sick. I'm going to offer my ear ( or eyes) of you're frustrated and want to vent and I'm going to tell you jokes and share memes with you if you need to laugh. I'm going to tell you goodnight when I'm leaving and I'm going to hope you have a good life and that good thing happen to you and it's going to happen I'm record time that Usain Bolt is going to look at me and say "" wow, she's fast.""

And you? You're going to ghost me. You're going to take all that I have to offer, all my memes, all my bad puns, all my willingness to brighten your day and you're going to throw it in her trash with the click of a button. Why? Because to you, I am not a person on a device searching, just like you but a name or an icon on a screen that you can never see again if you don't want to. You can forget and move on cause you didn't care like I cared. You can walk away without a second thought to what feelings I have. You don't care about what I have to say and don't have to see it. Must be nice.


This venting turned into an open letter but in the end i found it therapeutic. It was nice to get off my chest. I really do hate how anxiety leaves me carrying the burden of things, be it the actions of other or myself. As I work to get better at pulling an Elsa and"" let it go"" I still know that it's harder for e to some degree because of how much I care for people and how easily I do it. When the fear of missing out and likewise the self bashing for letting someone in is done, I know i still haven't let it go. Is that me, or the anxiety that hangs on? I can't tell, but it's definitely the worst part of having anxiety to me.",usagispetrabbit,1

But then the second thought comes in and I am like, ""Shit, I feel fucking nervous off my ass that it wouldn't even be fun hanging out with people"" and it's just an endless circle of self-doubt and confusion.

What has helped me is just hanging out with one person at a time, and be in control of when I can go home if needed. To start by doing something simple and small, like going to a cafe, a bookstore or a laid-back movie.

I'm 20 and come from a large family and have always been really extroverted, happy childhood, but in these times all my mates have gone apart of course to go for university and stuff and I just now have my gap year between university.

I also can't pretend like it's okay cause it never works, it kind of has no effect





Another thing worth mentioning is a notion of humility: what if I'm too used to my past mates to connect with any new people? We had inside jokes and special types of behavior all the time and I don't know if that pulls with other new people, but mostly it's trying to get a way to look at everyone equally since in that group it was mostly also sort of 'shunning people who aren't us' type of behavior.

Maybe it's a weird selfish part of my brain but the thought of people have fun without me both just makes me upset and gives me the thought that there haveing fun because im not there.

why people in health anxiety are in too much worry so something bad will not happen to them they will catch it early or if they fail all they have in mind is DEATH...

for all those who have health anxiety or GAD other than some phobias just have to accept that one day sooner or later they have to embrace it either they are in panic or not...

so let say if a person has 365 days left its your choice to either enjoy the 360 days and keep that worry for 5 days or keep that worry for all 356 days and have a miserable life. Because whatever will happen is surely gonna happen your anxiety and worry cant change it...

2024-04-21 14:20:54,reddit_comment,"That‚Äôs very common for people with health anxiety. Worry and fear about your body supersedes all the other sources of anxiety in your life. It should be dealt with separately from ordinary anxiety. Avoid wrapping up your health anxiety with the other sources of grief and anxiety in your life. When people say anxiety they think both sources of anxiety are one in the same. Avoid doing that so as not to turn those into triggers. Your real anxiety is about your body. The other things that bother you are just triggers. I overcame health anxiety many years ago. Rest assured, you are safe. They did a huge long term study on people with  panic disorder and not one had a heart attack, died, or even fainted. The trick is not to struggle with it, as hard as that is. Give yourself time and don‚Äôt get too worked up about it. That‚Äôs the secret right there. At least don‚Äôt struggle with it the rest of the time when you aren‚Äôt getting symptoms and it‚Äôs  easier. This is about symptoms, not life anxiety if you have health anxiety. It‚Äôs not about your nervous system or your body, though you certainly activate it with your own what if thoughts. Don‚Äôt struggle with those what if thoughts either. Let them fade on by. I had thousands of panic attacks starting in the late 80‚Äôs and through the 90‚Äôs. I‚Äôm still here at 66. All that worry for nothing. It‚Äôs not going to go away overnight. It‚Äôs become an automatic response for your mind and body. The way out is not to do anything to MAKE  it go away, it‚Äôs to gradually let go to LET it go away. Don‚Äôt get frustrated if it comes back. Remember, it‚Äôs hard wired into you, but it‚Äôs not a real medical condition even though it has a very physical outcome. Therapy and taking care of your body are necessary but secondary. Don‚Äôt get too wrapped in those two. You got this. By grasping this concept and sticking to your guns you will come out way stronger than any mere mortal. In my mind, those of us who have overcome health anxiety are an elite bunch. It‚Äôll all look totally different once you make it to the other side.  Congratulations in advance.",vmtz2001,2

Here I am, a health nut who prioritizes kale smoothies and eight hours of sleep, constantly plagued by the fear of, well, everything being wrong with my health. It's not a fear of death itself, more like a terror of a slow, lingering illness that steals my vibrancy piece by piece.

It creeps in subtly. A dull ache in my shoulder morphs into a potential rotator cuff tear in my mind. A random bout of dizziness becomes a symptom of some obscure inner ear disorder I unearth on a late-night Wikipedia dive. It's a constant game of ""what if,"" a mental pinball machine bouncing between worst-case scenarios.

The worst offender? The internet. It's both a blessing and a curse. A simple search for ""fatigue"" transforms into a rabbit hole of potential diagnoses, each one more terrifying than the last.¬† Suddenly, every cough, every sneeze becomes a potential harbinger of doom.

Social life? It suffers.¬† Invites to weekend hikes or crowded bars send shivers down my spine. The thought of being in close quarters with a petri dish of germs sends me scrambling for excuses.¬† It's a lonely prison I've built around myself, all out of fear.

This constant state of hypervigilance is exhausting.¬† I'm missing out on life, the good and the bad, while I'm busy freaking out about the maybe's.¬† So, I'm fighting back.

It's a slow process, like chipping away at a stubborn rock.¬† I'm replacing endless internet searches with actual doctor visits.¬† Talking to a professional, someone who can separate fact from fiction, has been a game-changer. Health anxiety might always be a part of me, a nagging voice in the back of my head. But it doesn't have to control me.¬† I'm learning to manage it, to appreciate the strength and resilience of my body.¬† Because hey, even a hypochondriac deserves to enjoy a damn kale smoothie without picturing the potential E. coli lurking within.¬† Baby steps, right?",Journeyisunique,1

If it is it will give some relieve. He raised the point that some people die by accidents, drowned, cancer, heart attacks, burned and the list continues. Its always tragic and comes with pain...

2024-04-22 14:04:08,reddit_comment,"I see meds as helpful, but only to a point. Even the companies that produce meds say they aren‚Äôt a definitive solution. They suggest therapy and cognitive therapies. Meds were an aid to me. You can‚Äôt expect them to do the heavy lifting, in other words. In my case I eventually became convinced that my anxiety and the symptoms were not really a medical condition, or a threat for that matter. Reassurance is only good to point, however. What is needed is that you let go. That takes time. Not seeing this as a threat and being willing to expose myself to symptoms  was a major turning point. But only a professional can determine what is causing your anxiety. Try to find a coach who has actually gone through this and actually beat it. As for attitude being the real cause for me, there‚Äôs a grey area there. Rest and the health of your nervous system are factors. Just don‚Äôt get too wrapped up in that. If you do, you are making triggers out of those concerns. Same goes for therapy. Emotional problems are a factor, but in my case they weren‚Äôt the direct cause. They were what brought me to that point. I have known a few people who attribute their success more to the meds. I can see that, but they also tell me that what I told them helped. The vids I sent helped. Yes, it requires courage to expose yourself, that‚Äôs why you need to take it one step at a time. Don‚Äôt overthink this, just realize what this is, a false alarm. It‚Äôs so hard not to view this as not being a medical condition IF IT ISN‚ÄôT  because the symptoms are so real. But eventually I realized it was my thinking prior to an attack that was causing it. That‚Äôs why I stress changing your way of looking at in general when it‚Äôs not happening and not so much doing something to stop it. That just makes you more anxious. Just realize this isn‚Äôt a matter of doing, or following any kind of method. Your general day in day out self talk is what you need to work on. You can‚Äôt meet it head on and stop it when you have the symptoms because the mere fact that you are engaging it and bothered by it triggers that programmed response. Fighting this is precisely what keeps it alive. So as you read this, rather than focusing on how to stop this from happening, see thus as not being an issue, even though when it happens it is an issue to you. That way over time you will become desensitized to it. So right now, think to yourself, I‚Äôve got this. I can handle it. Then leave it alone. No more ‚Äúbut I try,‚Äù or I know but I can‚Äôt help but think about it, my thoughts betray me. Your subconscious is listening. Stop scaring your child. Be the adult in the room.",vmtz2001,2

One time I was so worried about getting an anxiety attack, worried about my heart that after it was  all over I realized my mind forgot to create symptoms.

If it's important enough, it'll become a talking topic at work. Then I can find my sources as I please instead of having a filter feed of media. 99% of what you see in the news, you don't have any control over anyway and usually isn't useful for everyday information to warrant it being something I see/hear about everyday.

It also didn‚Äôt help that I had people in my life actively encouraging me to jump the line (my MIL found a glitch in the health department website and tried to schedule appointments for my husband and I when vaccines were only available to healthcare workers, which we are not). I wasn‚Äôt going to do that, and all the pressure was just too much for me.

I mean, the internet can be a great place to make friends and be sociable without having to go out in public, allowing you to get better at being social without as much fear as you might otherwise have.  


However, you can be social on the internet without engaging too much on social media. I find chat rooms are still the best way to connect with people, sites like Discord for instance.  


Unfortunately, social media sites are driven largely by algorithms, and those algorithms promote any content that gets engagement, which results in a lot of people trying to make the most outrageous content they possibly can in order to encourage people to respond with anger, rage, fear, worry, sadness, etc.  


And I'm not just talking about political nonsense, I mean like...even those stupid videos with people showing you ""the best way to cook something,"" and it's always the most ridiculous way to cook it? I've got news for you. They don't actually believe that's the ""best way"" to cook whatever they are cooking. They're making content that will drive people to respond with ""wtf"" or ""why.""   


They do this because it sells. They can make money off the ads.  


But you see what I'm saying, right?  


All content on social media...well, by and large an overwhelming majority of it...is designed from the bottom up to OUTRAGE you, to piss you off, to get you so anxious that you respond in the comments.  


And since social media is currently designed around algorithms that are essentially an attack on the senses of anyone who has an anxiety disorder, it is absolutely a good idea to stay off of it as much as possible.  


What I recommend for first steps is simply to start blocking/muting/banning any content or users who are saying or doing outrageous things, because they are almost certainly in it to trigger you -- perhaps not directly YOU, but anyone who is susceptible to such outrage content.  


From there, if you really feel the need to respond to someone, make sure it's someone commenting on a post or subject that is not intentionally outrageous.  


Ever since I started blocking every sh\*thead I see on Twitter, my timeline has been so much less frustrating and way more welcoming and useful. I also spend way less time on there, because I'm not getting caught in that outrage cycle.  


It might take a few months before you start feeling fairly ""back to normal,"" but chances are it will likely help with your mental state.",stoudman,1

Is there any way you can stay back a little later to check out some clubs like on Thursdays or Fridays? Or maybe see if there's events going on during the weekend? That way you could possibly get more involved. Have you been talking to anyone in class? If you're friendly with them, you could always ask them to study sometime whether in between classes or go out to a coffee shop together or get lunch on campus, something like that. I understand how you feel. I have a similar feeling sometimes with my friends as they seem really adjusted to college life and they have less time for me than they used to. I also have social anxiety so I know it's so hard to take those steps and put yourself out there for fear of rejection. Would you consider telling someone about how you're feeling or someone at the school? I think it could be helpful. Have you been to the organization fairs or seen flyers for things you're interested on campus? It can be easier to talk to people when you have something to bond over. Even if you can't do these things right away, maybe you can make it a small goal to go somewhere instead of staying in your room.

However, after leaving high school I began working more often, lost contact with a lot of my friends and spent a lot more of my free time on with my girlfriend. 

I eventually fell into a deep depression. Life became boring and I really began to lose interest in life. I was unaware of why I felt like this, and it wasn‚Äôt until recently that I realised it was because I didn‚Äôt have many friends. I had cut off so many good people, and it made life uneventful and uninteresting.

About three weeks ago, I reached out to them again, and surprisingly, they were really pleased to hear from me. We have started to hang out every day and I love it. I honestly feel like my old self again, my depression is non-existent when I‚Äôm around them and I feel like life is once again exciting. They genuinely enjoy my company and it‚Äôs almost like my world got a fresh layer of paint, something to look forward to.

All of them work part-time and go to University, so their schedules are very flexible. We mainly hang out in the evenings between 8pm and 1am almost every night, which is fine because at the moment I work 10am to 6pm.

I recently got offered a promotion at work (which I‚Äôve been working at for a long time), which requires me to work 12 hour days, and occasionally weekends. These hours are 10am - 10pm.

I‚Äôve accepted the job, but I‚Äôm now worried I won‚Äôt be able to see my friends and girlfriend anymore. I have a massive fear of missing out on hanging out with them, drifting once again  and being left out, becoming depressed.

This week I‚Äôm on a holiday, and when seeing them all hang out without me I worry that I will drift out of the group. 

I think I may be overthinking it, but I‚Äôm not sure and need some advice on what I should do. Do you think I‚Äôll still be invited to things if I can‚Äôt seem them as much, and at my age do you think I will be able to maintain a healthy work/life balance?

Any advice is appreciated, thank you.",JamituWorld,2
2018-03-30 10:56:57,reddit_post,"FOMO-induced anxiety I am a college student, female, age 21, in the US - diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I currently take buproprion and desvenlafaxine.

I was in an emotionally abusive relationship for two years. He isolated me from others, prevented me from being involved in activities outside our relationship, and got jealous every time I would try to hang out with someone other than him. I have a lot of regret and guilt for the time I missed with my friends and the experiences I missed in those two years. 

Since then, I've been dating someone for almost a year who is so sweet, kind, and supportive. He is amazingly understanding about so many things about me, especially my past abusive relationship and the resulting anxiety and emotional issues that stem from it.

I have a lot of difficulty when I know I am missing out on something. It's like severe fear of missing out (FOMO), and it's anxiety-inducing. It comes around when I know my friends are having fun and doing things that I'm not able to attend, and it also comes around when my boyfriend is hanging out with his friends, too. I hate feeling this way, because it reminds me of how my ex treated me, but I don't know what I can do to stop it. I really do think it's extreme FOMO, and I can't control it, and it always triggers an axiety attack.

I have tried therapy. My therapist always made me remember that, ""I made the best decision I could with the information I had"" in regards to staying with my ex and tolerating his abuse. I have tried to repeat this to myself and to believe it, but the intense guilt and regret that I have always overcomes it.

I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience. I want to be more accepting and less worried about missing out, but I don't know how.

EDIT: I'm new to this subreddit and I read the rules about not posting anxiety inducing things. I'm not sure if this falls under that, but if it does, I will take my post down. ",eboaylag,5

I was also in a domestic violence situation for about a year, and then did trauma therapy with someone who wasn't trained in this type of therapy (she had warned me about this beforehand, but I was comfortable with her and too terrified to find a new psychologist). Two years later, I'm now about to start going through trauma therapy again with someone who is trained in it. Besides the occasional nightmares, I realized I hadn't properly processed the trauma because I still couldn't bring myself to talk about what happened out loud (even in the vaguest of terms) without bursting into tears. So maybe the guilt and regret you're feeling is a sign that the trauma hasn't really been processed properly? Just my guess based on my own experience with it. ",heraclitic,2

Theres been days where I get up at noon eat and go lay down in the bathtub until my Dad gets home really I just hate being alone I guess. It sounds like you have a fear of flight which is rational but also limits you in your daily life as does my anxiety of being away from people. Really what has honestly worked for me is absolutly forcing myself to do things people say oh just do it youve got it in you which is true but nevertheless makes you not want to do it. Maybe if its say terrorists on a plane that scare you try and take a ride in a small plane first if your in the south like me which hell I aint even sure your in the States try and ask around and see if you can fly in a croo duster plane. They're very low flying planes and seem usually be accident free hell maybe even ride in a helicopter. You just got to face your fears head on maybe like I do first imagine yourself doing it and then actually go do it. I'll give you an example after my mom died i really hated being far away from Dad hell I still do but I guess about 5 months after she died I made myself get out of the house and do stuff I met a fella who is in to reenacting the civil war so I made myself go out to old washington Arkansas state park which is almost two hours away from home I camped outside made a lot of new freinds and even got to teach people there about the civil war now that was the first step the second was to go even farther I got called up by my good buddy and he said that he was going down south to Baton rouge and doing a little reenactment down there so for the first time in my life I was going to be a state away from my family hell I also have a little fear of the road so it didnt help that my buddys pickup was 20 years old and had three hundre thousand miles and nearly bald tires but I did it anyways and I had a great time it was hard as hell I called Dad a bunch and was still pretty scared but it worked out good anyway hope this helps :),unboxingusa1234,2
2015-06-30 11:40:09,reddit_post,"How to cope with FOMO or Social Media Envy [help] FOMO is the feeling you get when you see other people doing cool shit with their lives and suddenly you suffocate on the boring atrocity that is your every day existence. You are experiencing a fear that you have made the wrong choices on how to spend your life, so you spend even more time obsessing over what other people are doing with theirs. In addition to FOMO there is social media envy, which is when you look at the life that another person has and you constantly feel like you have to compare yourself to them. All of a sudden you need a fancy wedding like theirs, or to go out to fancy restaurants or to be prettier. Pinterest, Instagram, and Facebook are all major contributors to these feelings because they offer very open access to other people‚Äôs lives. What we don‚Äôt consider is that these social media websites are not reality, but instead are a small representation or rather a highlight reel from someone else‚Äôs life.
While both envy and the fear that you aren‚Äôt living your life to the fullest potential have always existed, with social media they seem to be more prevalent because it only takes one click to look into your neighbors house and see what it is that they have or that they do that you yourself do not have or have not done. So here are my questions:  
1. Is this a penetrating feeling in your life? Do you experience FOMO or social media envy?  
2. Do you find yourself tactfully creating a narrative or an identity that you know other people will be envious of, or in other words to impress others?  
3. In contrast, do you reject social media because of the way people act on it and avoid it all together? Do you choose to unfollow certain people rather than rejecting it all together?  
4. Do you think your experience is different based on your race or gender?  
5. How do you cope with the emotions or anxiety resulting from FOMO or social media envy?  
  
Below I have provided my story as well as method of coping, if you too have recommendations or a personal story please share.

Here are some rules that I have come up with to cope with FOMO and envy even though they may not be the best tactics (which is why i'm asking for better ones)‚Ä¶
  1. Don‚Äôt ever complain on the Internet or say anything depressing or sad, people don‚Äôt like it.
  2. Only post pictures of yourself that you have had taken after getting your hair or makeup done.
  3. Anytime you do any sort of social event take pictures and put them online, it looks like you are more social than you are.
  4. Take at least 15 pictures and pick the best one before posting a picture of just yourself. If you are in a group always do the same pose, a flattering one.
  5. Don‚Äôt post something too racy, but post classy sexy pictures because something too racy is ignored by other women, but just enough will have others envious.
  6. Always post about big life events, vacations, or happy moments‚Ä¶

  These might seem redundant or even obvious, but for me they made a world of a difference in my image. I went from being a girl who was bullied and ignored all throughout high school to being someone who is liked. I am still a nerdy girl who watches way too much TV and talks in cartoon voices. The second I get home I am in pajamas. I sing songs about everything I do around the house. I am an adult who watch cartoons and talk way too much to my cats‚Ä¶ but no one else would ever know it. I‚Äôve had girls who bullied me message me to tell me how beautiful I‚Äôve ‚Äúbecome‚Äù and I‚Äôve had people message me to tell me they never realized in high school how cool I was and inviting me to events. I have many friends in college that would have never given me the light of day four years ago‚Ä¶
  
I am just trying to be honest and introspective about my motivation to act the way I do when I‚Äôm online. Why do I narrate my life the way I do for others to read? How does social media both help and hinder me in accomplishing an establishment of my true identity? The truth is, it‚Äôs nice to feel pretty and wanted; it‚Äôs nice to feel like people are envious of you. We live in a world that values a particular image, and I have just spent years figuring out how to attain that image and harness its power. I am very studious at school and I also work almost thirty hours a week. I have a small collection of friends who I would do anything for. I have a really good life and the things I say online aren‚Äôt false‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre a hyperbole of who I am truly. You see one new photo of me online every three months because that‚Äôs how often I get my hair cut and colored and styled by a professional. I only post exciting things because in between those posts is a whole lot of Netflix, bagel bites, and long commutes, but the world doesn‚Äôt need to know that...
  
On the opposite end, there are still many times I find myself obsessing over someone else‚Äôs life on the Internet. I struggle on a daily basis about my choice to buy a house when I could be traveling the world like the select few international students I met at college and a few American friends. Even when I look at my own best friends account I think about how fucking cool she is, why is she so much cooler than me? I know it isn't true (because we're both awesome and I love her) but her instagram still makes me feel uncool...I am envious of her photo editing abilities and her fashion sense. When a high school friend of mine spent a summer in Paris it made me question all of my choices. I am turning that motivation around and I do try very hard to convince myself to turn it into something healthy and go travel while also keeping myself grounded and steady with my career choice. Why not both? My ultimate dream is to be a stand up comedian and I can‚Äôt even figure out how to say something hilarious on the Internet, I am so jealous of many of the people on Imgur and Reddit because they are so hilarious. Why can‚Äôt I think of something witty to say? Despite all that I have accomplished in my life there are others who seem to have accomplished more, and we all want to suck every last drop out of life right?
  
I have read ways in which to cope with FOMO and social media envy and the thing that I try to think about most is ‚ÄúWould you rather be doing what you are doing now or what they are doing‚Äù. We find ourselves staring into the lives of others, but are we truly happy with our own decisions. Are we happy with Netflix and sushi? Most of the time my answer back is yes, I would much rather be doing this than climbing that mountain. It helps me cope. When the answer is no, I would much rather be doing what they just did, then I know it is not just social media envy and then I can focus on a way about changing my situation so that I can turn envy into personal experience. The truth is, they don‚Äôt have anything I can‚Äôt have and if I truly want it I can do it.",THEcateleesi,2
2015-06-30 22:06:31,reddit_comment,"> 1. Is this a penetrating feeling in your life? Do you experience FOMO or social media envy?

A bit, but then I remember that everyone is just posting shit to make themselves look better, so that makes it all much easier to stomach. 

>2. Do you find yourself tactfully creating a narrative or an identity that you know other people will be envious of, or in other words to impress others?

Yes and no. I try to keep facebook posts light and enjoyable. I don't air dirty laundry online (except for here, of course, where it's not attached to my real identity). Rather than being liked, I think my primary objective is to not offend. I don't post religious or political content. I try and interact in pleasant ways online. But I don't feel like I've created any sort of ""identity"" that's separate from myself, I just omit a lot of the unpleasant stuff. 

>3. In contrast, do you reject social media because of the way people act on it and avoid it all together? Do you choose to unfollow certain people rather than rejecting it all together?

I only use facebook and I only use that occasionally, checking it probably 3-4 times a week. I'm not on instagram, pinterest, or any other social media. I actively hide content that I find offensive. I don't participate in heated discussion/debates. 

>4. Do you think your experience is different based on your race or gender?

No, but I guarantee it's different because of my age. I'm too old to feel any real pressure from social media. It makes it easy to opt out. 

>5. How do you cope with the emotions or anxiety resulting from FOMO or social media envy?

I drastically reduced my level of participation. I took a six month break from facebook when it started to bother me. I recognize that my responses to other people's social media presence were inappropriate and disproportionate, and I chose to distance myself from social media until I was able to handle it more comfortably. 

On top of that, I hide about 75% of my facebook ""friends"" from my news feed entirely. ",deleted,1

I'm pretty introverted so I'm okay with spending a lot of time alone, but what gets me is when I hear about or see (on social media) all of my friends doing fun stuff and having a great time, I feel like I'm really missing out.

When I was younger, I always wanted kids, I love kids, get along well with them, and really want one of my own one day.

As someone with anxiety, I would be so anxious beyond my daily anxiety levels just worrying about my life and another human‚Äôs life as well. It seems exhausting. 

I know I have a number of different kinds of anxiety (social anxiety, healthy anxiety, general anxiety), with a side of depression, occasional suicidal ideation/intrusive thoughts, and complex PTSD. But friends who know me well tell me I would be a good mother because of how sensitive I am, how emotional and caring I can be, and how loving I am in general.

2023-10-18 11:14:25,reddit_comment,"TW: Loss of pregnancy

I was first diagnosed with depression when I was 12, and panic disorder at 25. I've managed to keep my life in order, mostly, but I am a hot mess most of the time. 

I never particularly wanted kids. Then, when I was 38, I became pregnant. My partner and I had been together for six years at that point and had stopped using birth control because while we didn't necessarily WANT kids, we weren't opposed. After six years we figure it wasn't going to happen. 

At that age, I knew my chances of an easy birth were low. I spent a lot of time on online forums and found support groups for women of my age. I'm glad I did, because by the time I finally got in for my first ultrasound (there was an ugly ice storm that shut down the city for a while), there was no heartbeat. Honestly, I was relieved to some degree - I didn't feel ready. We were just coming off hard times and rebuilding our life. But once I knew I COULD become pregnant, I wanted to.   


I had a second, early miscarriage, which was disheartening but not devastating. In 2008 I gave birth to a son. I was 40. 

My first kiddo was so easy I was eager to have another, and became pregnant again about a year later. I carried that pregnancy to 14 weeks, and discovered at 16 weeks that it had been cut short. I was devastated. But we tried again. At 42 I had my second, very healthy child.   


It was years of struggle, and it's not getting easier as we age and our children become teenagers and young adults. BUT THEY ARE AWESOME. They have managed to thrive despite our parenting style of ""benign neglect"" (I joke, a little).   


I think I would have been perfectly happy if I'd never had kids, but I'm very glad I did. I'm glad I enjoyed my younger years, when I knew I was too selfish to be a parent. It's going to be rough putting two kids through school at the same time we're hoping to retire - I'm not religious, but I'm taking it on faith that everything will work out.   


I've found a surprising number of parents who had kids at the same age I did. In some cases, they got their babies via adoption or foster care. Others have children with developmental disabilities. That can be incredibly hard, and I've seen the struggles they go through. I'm grateful that we didn't have to face that challenge, but I know I would adore my children regardless.   


Ultimately no one can choose for you whether you become a parent or not. (I realize that's not strictly true in this county anymore, but we'll save that discussion for another time.) If you don't want kids, don't have them. They will completely change your life in ways you can't even imagine. If you're on the fence, I can honestly say that I had a long, fulfilling young-adulthood, so I never missed out, and I love being a mom. My oldest is 15 now and it kills me that he'll be flying the coop in a short time. And it does go so fast.   


Pregnancy and childbirth are difficult and scary. Nobody should go into that situation without full awareness and the desire to be a parent. It will ruin your figure, destroy your gums and you will never be free from worry another day in your life. Is it worth it? For me, it is.

I feel the exact same way - with the same multiple anxieties, depression, suicidal/intrusive thoughts, but also ADHD with anger issues. When I was younger I actually wanted 4 kids! Now, the idea of even getting pregnant terrifies me. Being unable to care for my kid or potentially become abusive in any way terrifies me. Knowing my ADHD will most likely pass onto them terrifies me. 

My husband and I will be 30 soon and he really wanted to have kids by then. I voiced my anxieties to him before and he said I'm just making excuses and he hates these kinds of forums/subreddits because he thinks they're ""echo chambers of people who don't actually want to get better/put in any effort to get better"". I wouldn't have a kid purely to save a marriage, but it also does scare me that he'll leave me if I decide to not have kids after all. It hurts more that he'll probably think I wasted his time by constantly flip-flopping. 

I don't like the idea of people having kids just so they have someone to take care of them when they're older, especially since some just end up in retirement homes with no family contact anyways. But my older coworker said she persuaded her husband to have kids because her only friend was her husband and if she lost him, she would be extremely lonely. At first, it reminded me slightly of the former situation but as I get older and especially since I've moved overseas, I better understand her and how terrifying that loneliness is. I'm so lonely and cynical and feel like I'm doing nothing with my life and ruminate over everything I could have done better - it pushes me towards having a kid to have someone around that sees the world differently/positively that I can help support in ways I wasn't supported..but then I'm sure my parents thought the same when they had me and did their best and still look at how I turned out.

First of all, it's great that you have this sort of awareness. My mother didn't, and neglected me so badly due to her own mental health issues that I wished I wasn't born too many times to count. I'm not saying you would do the same, but as you're aware the risk is there. The thing is, getting into something so huge just out of FOMO is the perfect recipe for disaster. They say you can't pour from an empty cup, and that is so true. What you want to do now is focus on feeling better, taking all the time you need - you can't rush these things.

He claims I'd be a ""great mom,"" but I know myself. I wake up in the morning and struggle to get out of bed if there's too much for me to handle, and ""too much"" is anything from continuing to search for jobs after getting laid off, cleaning my home, getting ready for a social event, etc. Also, I feel awkward around kids, I'm germaphobic, and most concerningly, the thought of having one legitimately makes me feel suicidal since there's no escape from the responsibility.

Sometimes I wish I wanted kids just so I could appease my partner and be ""normal"" like other people. I look at parents with their kids and feel like an alien since I can't understand the desire to have kids.

>But they say time flies and kids won‚Äôt need you forever‚Ä¶  


&#x200B;

I disagree. Some people are independent early on, but *your* kid(s) may need you forever. Maybe they have a lifelong disability. Maybe they make the wrong choices and need you to bail them out. Maybe they leave you with the grandchildren all the time. They won't be helpless infants forever, but their needs change.

&#x200B;

>But friends who know me well tell me I would be a good mother because of how sensitive I am, how emotional and caring I can be, and how loving I am in general.

&#x200B;

I'm sure your friends mean well, but do they truly understand the degree of suffering you experience every day? Do they think about what you'd be like *after* having a child? Do they think you'd be *happy* to have a child or just *capable* of having one? Some parents don't understand that not everyone *should* have a child.

&#x200B;

>I feel almost less of a woman(?) for being childless. I know a lot of people are childless by choice‚Ä¶ and I wonder what made them choose to not have kids?

&#x200B;

I just...don't want kids. I don't think I'd enjoy the lifestyle and would resent making sacrifices. I would rather work on my mental health and enjoy life as much as possible. What's the point of being an unhappy parent?

&#x200B;

>I‚Äôve always wondered what getting older and not having kids feel like‚Ä¶ is it lonely?

&#x200B;

Personally, loneliness is at the bottom of my list of fears. You can feel alone in a room full of people (I often do thanks to my social anxiety). I'm sure that most parents have some sort of bond with their child, but you have to *raise* your child and hope they turn out right. Even if they're decent people, what if you don't share much in common with them? At least with friends, you *choose* them.

Anyway, do you want children enough to work through your anxiety, or are you just worried about missing out? Regardless of which path you choose, you're going to miss out on *something*. As for me, I realize that I need a low-stress life, but I also enjoy helping others. I don't feel like I need to have a child to express my caring nature; I can volunteer and be available for friends and family (and animals!) while balancing my own mental health.

I'm not trying to sway you either way, but please don't let anyone pressure you into having a child. Do the positives outweigh the negatives? Is the thought of, say, having a fun trip to the zoo with them more important than making sure they get their homework done every night? Is the stress worth the potential reward? I would say no due to my poor mental health and lack of desire to have kids, but some people may say yes if they're willing to sacrifice some sleep and sanity to find a way to enjoy parenting.

I think you need to ask yourself this: Are you able and willing to work on your mental health if you want a child badly enough?",GymLadyThrowaway,3

Doing the bare minimum in life is exhausting and challenging enough for me, and I fear that I would be bad at being a good mother because of it. 

I already decided not to even try getting pregnant because I can‚Äôt stand the thought of PPPD or PPA. I‚Äôm also not willing to risk a traumatic birth experience. I‚Äôm afraid my husband would be stuck caring for me in a bad mental state as well as a newborn. That being said, we talk about adoption a lot. I have heard that trying to adopt with diagnosed mental health conditions can be really difficult, though. I‚Äôd love to foster and show love to kids who need it the most, but I fear the interpersonal challenges of communicating with their parents. The struggle is very real. 

Despite all those reasons to avoid being a mom, I can tell that there‚Äôs something wonderfully fulfilling and special about being a parent; something my parent friends can‚Äôt quite put into words. I have a lot of love to give and being a mother could be a great fit.

I have a lot of respect for people who give a part of their life to care for another human being. Essentially being a full time forever caregiver to them for life (even if they are older and can take care of themselves I know a lot of moms who still cook and clean for their adult children).

2023-10-18 22:10:54,reddit_comment,"This is a lovely story (beside your losses). Thank you for sharing.

Pregnancy losses are another thing I worry about ‚Ä¶it‚Äôs sounds really sad and scary to have to pull out a dying or dead fetus. I can‚Äôt begin to imagine what that might even feel like‚Ä¶ I would probably have trauma from that experience or when I get the news. I get attached very quickly so that will be devastating to me and I wouldn‚Äôt know how to live knowing my baby died. Or worse, I .. killed (?) my baby?? Sometimes I feel like as a mom there is so many responsibilities and it start the moment you become pregnant, and not just once you give birth. 

During pregnancy, there are many things I‚Äôve heard of people having to be careful of for the sake of carrying the baby to term, and/or giving birth to a healthy one.

I have chronic stress just in general, health anxiety etc, so I worry a lot about what I eat, where I touch, where I go‚Ä¶ etc. it‚Äôs exhausting. I can‚Äôt imagine what it‚Äôs like to have something so precious that you are creating inside of you that you have to protect with all your might. 

People say life isn‚Äôt fair. Nothing is guaranteed. You just really don‚Äôt know how your life will change afterwards. You mentioned that your life and body will completely change, but I‚Äôve seen many people who bounced back within just a few years, looking great, feeling great, and like they were before becoming a mom‚Ä¶ maybe they are the exception? 

I heard childcare is expensive, and I‚Äôm not in a financially stable situation currently (especially not in this economy with inflation rising). And considering I do not have a relationship with my parents, I‚Äôm struggling to see how I would take care of my child, have a full time job, live decently comfortably, and give my child a decent life as well. It sounds stressful. 

I read somewhere a while ago that mental illness can be hereditary. I know how much I struggle with my own issues, so I can‚Äôt imagine passing this along to my kid to also suffer through‚Ä¶ it seems so unfair. 

Sometimes I wonder if people have kids for their life purpose? Fulfillment in life knowing they did something great before they passed? I kind of felt this before. But I‚Äôm not really sure anymore. To be frank, I struggle with finding my current purpose now as I grow older and life just seems boring and mundane. Maybe it‚Äôs the depression glossing over, but I sometimes wished time passed by faster. 

Seeing my friends kids, and how cute they are makes me waiver in my thoughts, and I get a brief moment of baby fever. But once I get back home ‚Ä¶ that feeling is gone, and I‚Äôm back to my reality. For context, I‚Äôm unmarried, live alone, and have a long distance relationship with my partner. 

Time seems to feel like it‚Äôs ticking fast as the years go by, and I fear that I will regret forever‚Ä¶. But at the same time I‚Äôm feeling lost and at a crossroads.

I would say I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm at a 99% not wanting kids‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs that nagging 1% full of ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù that got me to write this post to seek perspective. 

The thing is‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no turning back if you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt like it‚Äù‚Ä¶ but it could also be too late when your ovaries are all dried up. And I have a hard time making decisions when it comes to big ones that are possibly life changing. One wrong decision can also change your life. 

But I get what you‚Äôre talking about‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd say after reading your questions, and your thoughts‚Ä¶ I think that 1% just went down to 0.5%. 

I don‚Äôt know if it is selfish to want to prioritize myself, instead. Like as women and human beings we are not JUST meant to procreate right? I mean all animals procreate right? It is only natural, and I guess times have changed because I think most of our parents generations or Boomers/Gen X grew up only knowing to create a family and live their life that way. It‚Äôs the traditional way of life. Get married, have kids, and grow old. 

As a millennial, and I think most millennials too, we have become more aware of everything (traumas, mental health, etc) and ourselves in relation to others. As a result, we think a lot deeper, consider more areas and perspectives and not just follow the crowd. 

I think deep down I know my answer. But the nagging 0.5-1% is this fear of being judged, ridiculed, lacking of purpose, like I am an outcast, and I won‚Äôt have people to hang out with or relate to anymore. 

On the other hand‚Ä¶ I get my freedom, I can work on myself and be better, live my own life and be happy on my own terms‚Ä¶ without the need to take care of another human being and worry about someone else so much. 

As someone with suicidal ideation and intrusive thoughts occasionally‚Ä¶ one of the things I worry a lot is suddenly exiting the child‚Äôs life and then traumatizing them for life because their mother took her life. It‚Äôs so sad to think about this possibility. 

You‚Äôre right, my friends don‚Äôt know the extent to which I struggle‚Ä¶ it is intense sometimes, very dark too‚Ä¶ and when you‚Äôre parent you‚Äôre mostly by yourself with this child. No one will be there 24/7‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs tough if suddenly a depressive episode comes on‚Ä¶ or an anxiety attack appears out of no where‚Ä¶ if the child is young, they need you. 

And even when they‚Äôre older, who knows what kind of influence they may be under‚Ä¶ and with that comes worries, and fears, and more responsibility.

I guess I really wondered what a ‚Äúmini me‚Äù would look like‚Ä¶ and what it feels to have a special bond with someone who is ‚Äúpart you‚Äù. I guess this is one of the things that‚Äôs got one leg on the other side of the fence.",quietrovert,2

2024-10-15 02:27:46,reddit_comment,"I appreciate you sharing openly about your experience with your family. 

I can relate as both my parents also have some mental health issues - albeit undiagnosed but it was obvious to me as I got older. I‚Äôm also not surprised that they passed their illness onto me. Their issues rubbed off onto me and I learned from their habits and insecure attachment style. It is very sad. This is also why I realize I do not want to pass this along to the next generation. I know there‚Äôs no such thing as being ‚Äúfully healed‚Äù from childhood trauma or mental health illness. I know there is always a chance of passing along those issues to your kids one day or another. It‚Äôs human nature when someone triggers you - especially those that are closest to you. 

I was also an elementary school teacher for a few years and volunteered a bunch too. I can clearly see what kind of parents the kid must have by their behaviour in class and interactions with their peers. It is so sad to see when a kid is struggling ‚Ä¶ to make friends, to speak up, to share, to be kind, to listen to authorities, etc. I later learned that who we are and who we grow up to become is all thanks to the shaping from our parents or guardians (sometimes it may be absent, sometimes it may be poor parenting). It all affects us one way or another. I heard from some psychologists that no one is immune to childhood trauma. We all experience it, just at different degrees. Some people are fortunate enough to only experience ‚Äúsmall t trauma‚Äù, while others have experienced full blown (complex) PTSD. 

This is why I find it really disheartening when someone asks why I haven‚Äôt had kids yet when I‚Äôm of child bearing age‚Ä¶ or when will I do so. Those asking are usually older people or relatives etc. and I understand society deems it natural to just continue traditions this way.

2024-10-15 04:20:26,reddit_comment,"Well, I think you being self-aware is great and regardless of what you decide, at least you‚Äôre taking the time to really make a well-informed decision. Like you said, I think many people defaulted to having kids because it‚Äôs what everyone is expected to do. 


I‚Äôm always hesitant to share my views because I realize at the end of the day, it‚Äôs not my decision to make. My best friend of 15 years just found out she‚Äôs pregnant and I‚Äôll admit, I am very concerned about her. She is consistently stressed/overwhelmed about life in general, thinks the world is a terrible place, and really struggles to get out of bed so many days. She‚Äôs panicked about not being able to take her medications while pregnant. I foresee her having a difficult time. 


Like you, one of the many reasons I opted out of having children was due to my mental health and realizing that I need a lot of rigid structure/certain routines in order to maintain it. Parenthood requires a level of flexibility that I don‚Äôt think I could do without taking a significant hit to my overall wellbeing. Showing up for my partner and family is challenging enough. And seeing my grandparents still have to battle with my mentally unstable parents as adults has been very disheartening. Fortunately, they‚Äôre very supportive of my childfree decision because of their experiences. I had my tubes taken out two years ago and had a no baby shower! It was fun. 


But anyways, I truly wish you all the best! You‚Äôre asking all the right questions, in my opinion.",RubyRabbit91,2

2024-09-13 21:52:23,reddit_comment,"I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that you are struggling. I think the other thing for me is that I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends, and struggle to make friends. So I think even if I thought maybe I can try having kids and get support - that isn‚Äôt going to happen :( I really think that being a parent needs to be a conscious and responsible decision. It‚Äôs not something you can just return if you don‚Äôt like it‚Ä¶ I mean some people do abort or give up the kid to foster care and I think that‚Äôs just really sad. I know being a parent is expensive financially, emotionally and physically. I cannot afford it right now‚Ä¶ and a year ago I had guilt over potentially not fulfilling my womanhood‚Ä¶ but fast forward today, I‚Äôve learned more about what being a parent means, and who I am as a person and my own needs. Who knows, maybe 5 years down the road I may change my mind and maybe in a better place? lol, but as of right now, I am still young, and I know for sure I cannot be a parent.",quietrovert,3

As a perfectionist I struggle to start or commit to anything because I worry I‚Äôm not good enough. Or I compare myself a lot to others.

2024-10-15 22:52:26,reddit_comment,"You‚Äôre right, at the end of the day anybody‚Äôs choice about their life or body is their own business‚Ä¶ even if it is your best friend. You can only control your own life and your own decisions.

Even though some people may not be conscious in their decisions, we can only do so much in giving advice or sharing our opinions without overstepping. 

I‚Äôm happy for your decision, because you seem to be happy about that. I did consider or think about ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù contraceptives‚Ä¶ as I do get worried sometimes ‚Ä¶ you know about accidents üòÖ lol but I‚Äôm also terrified of ‚Äúprocedures‚Äù? I‚Äôve never had any done in my life so it‚Äôs scary!  I‚Äôve just been super careful!

I completely agree without regarding the structure required in my life in order to be sane. I actually get really frazzled and anxious when plans change or plans suddenly spring up on me out of the blue. I have trouble making decisions as it is‚Ä¶ so I will be very distressed very often. People claim that the ‚Äúyounger years‚Äù of kids go by quickly‚Ä¶ but to be honest, even when the kid is grown‚Ä¶ and even after they turn 18, they will forever be a ‚Äúkid‚Äù in a mother‚Äôs eyes and heart. At least that‚Äôs what I think, if I were to ever to become a mother. I will always worry, always think about them‚Ä¶ have they eaten? Where are they (past certain late hours)? Or what do they need? How do I support them through tough times etc‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a lot. 

I think at least a few of my friends I know, have had baby fever for a while, and I think reality hit them pretty quick when their child became sick‚Ä¶ because the entire family goes down too. It‚Äôs stressful and tiring.

Life itself is quite stressful and tiring as an adult, I really don‚Äôt want to neglect my child, nor give up my sanity and wellbeing either. It is such a difficult choice.. I really don‚Äôt know how some people do it. Although, I do know some people have grandparents to help, or can afford a nanny‚Ä¶ I hear about parenthood burn out a lot. And as someone who is very susceptible to burn out as an introvert, I think it is something I need to think long and hard about.

All the best to you kind stranger :)",quietrovert,2

2023-10-30 04:59:51,reddit_comment,"Maybe you can expand your friend group without necessarily giving up the old ones. My partner and I have different friend groups, some of whom meet each other and some of whom don't (very few of them have children, though).

I understand why you feel left out. I would also feel weird if I were in a friend group who brings their kids, talks about their kids too much, etc. I'm glad your friends don't pressure you, though.

As I said before, I sometimes feel like an ""alien"" when I see strangers going about their life with their children in tow. I think since we've been the outliers for so long, we feel like we're ""missing out."" I try to remind myself that even if I'm ""missing out"" by not being like others, I'd also be ""missing out"" on being myself if I followed what they did.",GymLadyThrowaway,2
2024-10-17 10:12:14,reddit_comment,"Exactly. If my friend ever asked me for my honest opinion, I would give it. However, she's known me for fifteen years, and I have always been very vocal about my stance on children - something tells me she knows, which is why she doesn't ask :).

As for the procedure, if you ever look into it - I had a bilateral salpingectomy. It was a quick, simple outpatient procedure. Sadly, I still get periods. But no more birth control or concerns! I went back to work the next day after a full day of heating pads and Gilmore Girls. Nothing more than Tylenol was needed. Obviously, I'm not trying to sway you; I just thought I would share my experience. 

And also, YES! I agree totally. My partner is much more extroverted than I am, and we had to enforce a 24-hour notice rule. He would often come home excited about people inviting us somewhere at the last minute, and I would get instantly stressed/overwhelmed. Even if my plan for the remainder of the day was only to ""read a book in the hammock, work out, and go to bed early."" I had already mapped out my day. I also require lots of alone time. 

And even though the young kid phase comes and goes quickly, that's only IF you are lucky enough to have a totally healthy, well-adjusted child. My grandparents are worn down, still paying for my 52-year-old father's car, house note, etc., because he has major substance abuse problems and has been in and out of jail/rehab his entire life. My mother has BPD and a butt-load of issues as well that she consistently makes her parents problems (as well as mine). Maybe that's not the norm, but watching both sets of grandparents still raise their 50+-year-old ""kids."" Nope. 

I also know that I would really really WANT to be the best possible parent, but I lack the patience, etc. And I would feel horrible knowing my child was neglected because I was too busy shutting down from being overwhelmed.",RubyRabbit91,1

2024-10-01 18:43:28,reddit_post,"Concert Advice  Hi all - 

I‚Äôm 18 years old and supposed to go to the eras tour in November. I went last summer as well, but got tickets to this show at the end of last summer. In April, I had a major anxiety breakdown and couldn‚Äôt eat/be in a car/leave the house without having a panic attack for about a month or so. In May, I spent all of it trying not to have more panic attacks. I have emetophobia, and I felt nauseous from anxiety so I was constantly at the peak of my anxiety. I tried to drive to the beach with my friends in May, and had a panic attack in the passenger seat. I am now remedicated on Zoloft and it seems to mostly help. I can now drive for I know at least 45 minutes without having a panic attack. The concert is 2.5 hours away and I‚Äôm supposed to go with 2 of my friends but they‚Äôre both in college so my girlfriends family would drive me down and already rented out 2 hotel rooms (cancellable)

My anxiety hasn‚Äôt been tested in a while since I haven‚Äôt had a chance to go anywhere far away. I haven‚Äôt had a car panic attack in months, but I‚Äôm worried about the sound in the concert and having a panic attack in front of my friends. I don‚Äôt want to be almost 3 hours from home and freaking out about the car ride. I‚Äôm not sure if I can do it and I‚Äôd rather disappoint them than have a panic attack and ruin their night. I‚Äôd probably sell the ticket to one of my friends who is also their friends if I did sell it. 

I need advice. The pros to cancelling are a weight lifted off of my shoulders and not having to be scared anymore. The cons are I will miss the concert, maybe disappoint my friends, etc. The only thing I have fomo about is surprise songs and/or if she announces anything (Indy N3). I‚Äôd be devastated if something happened and I was supposed to be there, but I‚Äôm not sure how to guarantee I won‚Äôt freak out while there. I trust once I‚Äôm in the venue it would probably be fine but getting there and getting out is really scaring me. It was the best day of my life last time, but I was with my girlfriend and I wasn‚Äôt having this anxiety. 

Please help me

2024-10-01 19:37:22,reddit_comment,"Hello! Panic disorder/anxiety sufferer and Zoloft user here!

My first suggestion is asking your psychiatrist (or whoever is managing your Zoloft Rx) for a medication like Ativan to use as-needed when you feel a panic attack coming on. This has been a total game changer for me and is one of the only things that helps me be able to eat when my anxiety is making my nausea bad. It is a sedative, so will likely make you a bit drowsy - and should NEVER be mixed with alcohol - but it is so helpful for me when my anxiety is at its worst.

My second suggestion is to get concert ear plugs. Mine are from Loop, but there are lots of options out there. Not only are they a good choice for protecting your ears from hearing damage, I also find them very helpful to keep me from getting overstimulated in a crowded, loud environment. They reduce the decibels of whatever you are listening to without completely muffling or distorting the music.

Thank you so much for your message you‚Äôre super sweet. Does ativan make you like really drowsy? I took Dramamine and had a panic attack because it felt like I was high (I‚Äôve greened out too many times so I stopped smoking about a year and a half ago) so I started freaking out. Otherwise, I can try it definitely! I‚Äôm just super sensitive. 

I do have loop earbuds! They‚Äôre amazing and helped me the last time I went just with the sound. I also have autism so they‚Äôre helpful always. 

I will definitely try to take it slow going in and out. Do you have any advice about not freaking out in the car? Sometimes I remember where I am (in a high speed car) and it makes me panic. Thank you so much anyway even if you don‚Äôt have answers, you‚Äôre super helpful :)",moonwhore444,1

I‚Äôve recently moved to a new city for college and I‚Äôm really struggling with being away from home. I try to visit home once or twice a month, but every time I have to leave again, I‚Äôm hit with intense anxiety. It‚Äôs especially tough because I‚Äôm in a long-distance relationship, and saying goodbye to my boyfriend and family especially my mother always feels so hard. It's always excruciatingly hard to leave and I get such bad anxiety. I will move back home eventually in 2.5 years but that feels like such a long time. I have an internship right after college as well to keep myself busy. I do have 2-3 good friends there who make my time there okay but its still nothing compared to being home.

On top of that, I‚Äôve been dealing with a lot of FOMO (fear of missing out). I worry about missing out on making memories with my family, my boyfriend, and my close friends back home. It feels like life is moving on without me, and that thought is so overwhelming. 

Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you make peace with being away from home, your significant other, or close friends for long periods? Did you find any strategies that helped ease the anxiety and FOMO? I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice or tips on how to cope better with these feelings.",onlinehuman1234,6

First of all, you have your whole life ahead of you, please don't worry about missing out because there is so much time to experience this messy and fantastic thing called life. When I get overwhelmed I usually try to appreciate the moment I'm in, which meditation can help you understand and practice, not only when actively meditating. If that's not for you I totally understand, but honestly I think it's the thing that's helped me most in my life even though it can  seem hard to get started on. There's an app called Headspace which I highly recommend for easing into it, with clear and kind guidance.

This whole situation is new for you, so of course it is going to peak your anxious feelings. I think you should keep that in mind, and go easy on yourself for feeling that way. That's okay. With time I am sure that you will get used to travelling back and forth, maybe try to notice if, and how your anxiety reduces just a tiny bit each time you go through it? 

  
Also, talk to someone! Call your friends, your boyfriend, your mom, whatever, and just tell them how you feel. Let it out. The hardest thing can be to keep it to yourself, as if you only need to manage this on your own. The world and those that care about you are there if you reach out to them, and sometimes saying it out loud and knowing you're not alone in feeling this or that way, is the most comforting thing of all. 

Other than that I'd say look into hobbies or sports that keep your mind and body occupied in a way that is fun for you. Maybe natural supplements can help reduce some of the stress in your body as well, there are plenty of options in that area. I personally have had a lot of help from taking CBD oils and overall getting my vitamins when I'm feeling anxious.",somegrass,1

I get this FOMO that I'm not doing anything in life. I have to study for an exam which I'm not doing. I bought a new apple laptop which I don't know how to use the UI and kinda feeling guilty that did I waste money, or I should have spent more money to buy with a better memory - it was affordable from my end.  

  
I start remembering all the things I did wrong in my life, what I was supposed to do, every action of mine comes with a negative reaction because of which I shut down and start to procrastinate things all over again. Life feels so suffocating. No matter what I do, I will feel like I'm falling behind on things. I'm not even concentrating on the work I'm supposed to do. 

My dating life is uncertain, I don't see a future with the guy I'm dating. He is a nice person, but its more like me using Mac, its probably not for me. But I need to give it time. What if I'm wasting the time being with someone whom I know for sure there is no future and miss out on the one whom I have a future with. I feel I'm so rude by actually telling this, but I feel so uncertain, confused about everything. I feel so unworthy of love, emotions, whatever good that is happening to me, so much. 

I don't have any emotional support from anyone. I can't go and tell my parents about stuff. My brother doesn't care. I can tell my friends, but how much are they going to listen if I keep ranting all the time. I feel like I'm disturbing people by calling. I feel like a burden all the time. Its not like my friends just ignore me or anything, they like me and enjoy spending time with me. But I feel like such a drag that I don't even make an effort to be in contact because of my own issues. 

  
I want to change the pattern of how my thinking works. I want to control my anxiety. I want to know for sure that I am in a safe place and to let things go while I'm unsure of what is happening and when things are uncertain. 

  
For once, I want my mind to be calm and let things go the way they are supposed to go instead of being hard on myself. Life is supposed to be easy right?? Not this complicated ",No-Bumblebee-110,3

2024-08-17 18:52:15,reddit_post,"Terrified of upcoming travel to earthquake prone city My partner and I were meant to spend two weeks in Japan with our friends, but I've been feeling really afraid after last week's megaquake advisory. I love Japan, I know their infrastructure is fantastic, that there's no way to predict earthquakes, how small the probability of a megaquake happening is, and that I shouldn't let my life be determined by my anxiety. But all of that knowledge doesn't take away the dread I feel and the intrusive thoughts that pop up. 

I've watched/read hundreds of reports, papers, documentaries, you name it, all to try and get a better understanding of how bad it could be and how I could prepare myself. But I've never experienced any natural disaster before and don't trust myself to survive it if it really does happen. 

It feels like there's no point of going on a holiday where I'll constantly be terrified and on my toes. This is not a new trigger for me and the last time I went to Japan I had anxiety attacks surrounding this fear, but my anxiety was manageable as no one *else* was freaking out ‚Äî unlike now, where there have been thousands of cancelled plans after the advisory went up.

On the other hand, every time I decide ""Alright I won't go,"" I'm filled with so many negative feelings as well. Sadness that I won't be there (my partner still has to go as this trip involves responsibilities he's committed to fulfil), fear for his and my friends' safety, FOMO that I'll be missing out on all the fun, and shame that I let my anxiety win. I've pinballed between Go and Don't go so many times I've lost count and there's been a huge knot in my tummy for days. 

I'm not looking for reassurance because I know no one can offer that. I've seen others ask similar questions in other subreds and get responses like ""If you're so scared you might as well never leave your house since it's more likely you'll die in a car crash"". 

I wish more people understood disordered anxiety and the tug of war we have with all the things we want to do and all the debilitating fear that gets in the way. I feel so stuck and frozen in my indecision, and am not at peace at all with either decision. I really would appreciate any advice, support, or commiseration with my fellow anxiety sufferers.

About Japan. This is of course very different. Earthquakes DO happen. We all will die one day. Life is scary as f...


My only advice which has sometimes worked for me is to be fatalistic. Tell yourself that whether you will end up in a catastrophe or be hit by a bus is out of your hands. Your destiny is your destiny. Whatever will happen is written in the stars already. So Whatever you decide to do that IS your destiny. Your fate. You cannot avoid it.


Therefore, live your life. Go to Japan. Or stay home. But know that Whatever happens has already been decided for you. So you cannot make disaster or death come sooner by any action you take. It's not up to you. There is no free will.

Basically, I was advised by many of my Taiwanese friends to not go to Hualian. So that‚Äôs me and my partner did. We went to many places BUT Hualian. Perhaps coincidentally, there was a 4.7 earthquake in Hualian right after we left. So, whether it was dangerous or not, I‚Äôm thankful I headed the warning of my friends.

Moral of the story, I didn‚Äôt read up on all the news of exactly where the quakes happened in Japan, but if I were you I would avoid the areas where the earthquakes happened. I don‚Äôt know much about ‚Äúmegaquakes‚Äù though, and how far they can reach. Education is power. Read up and educate yourself about the risks. At the end of the day it is a country that experiences A LOT of earthquakes and you can‚Äôt erase that aspect, but what you can do is educate yourself and be smart about navigating traveling a country with earthquakes.

2024-09-18 01:59:04,reddit_post,"Panic attacks are ruining my life As the title suggests, I‚Äôve been having an extremely high level of anxiety of the past few months. Most of it starts from anticipation of travel. This could be a car ride for 6+ hours or getting on a two hour flight. I‚Äôve been on Zoloft for many years now, and had used it as a medication to treat social phobia I was going through during college. But now things are back to its worst. 

Most of my life since college has been great. Mild panic attacks occurred infrequently, but I felt capable to handle them. Enter a few months ago where I had to cancel a vacation of mine, which I had been looking forward to (without anxiety) until the night before. I had a mental breakdown and had to cancel. This broke me. I missed a trip that my wife planned for me for my birthday and it killed me. I stayed home, and she went (part of the trip was for her work, so no harm there) but I couldn‚Äôt help but feel like I had failed her. I‚Äôd failed me. 

I start to have feelings of fomo and guilt and beat myself up about missing such great opportunities, because I can‚Äôt seem to get out of my own way. When I cancelled the trip I felt immense relief, followed by extreme shame. How could I have just cancelled my trip? It was going to be a blast. 

Since that I started going to a therapist where we are working out things together, but I still have panic attacks like no other and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. My therapist is great, and it‚Äôs still new so I don‚Äôt expect to have ‚Äúsolved‚Äù myself so quickly, but I‚Äôm looking for help from you guys. 

I have another trip planned to do a drive to visit my parents in another state about a days drive away. This trip is Sunday. Today is Tuesday. Since yesterday I‚Äôve had nothing but severe panic attacks in the morning, and general unease throughout the day. I haven‚Äôt been sleeping well, and the anxiety just makes me nauseous. Talking about the trip triggers me into a spiral where I just panic about panicking. I can‚Äôt help but feel guilty and upset with myself because this was yet again planned by my wife, who I love dearly. She is incredibly understanding but any time I feel anxious about doing something that she plans I feel like I‚Äôm worthless. Like I‚Äôm holding her back from enjoying the things she wants to enjoy. 

No matter what I pick, the feelings about it are never good. 

To anyone else who experiences GAD or Panic Disorders, how do you deal with this kind of problem? I‚Äôm feeling like I‚Äôm at the end of my rope and can‚Äôt see a way out. I‚Äôm hopeful my therapy will be helpful in uncovering *why* this happens but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs going to be enough. I need tools and skills. Or even more medication? I‚Äôm on a fairly low dose of Zoloft.

2024-09-11 13:54:39,reddit_comment,"The first step is to reach out. Many hands make a strong foundation. If you want tips to get out of the house or take your mind off the internet, just ask below! Just didn‚Äôt want to make this comment too long. Keep your head high, you got this


So what IS a panic attack?: you throughout the day like everyone else, have adrenaline rushes. This can happen in the morning when your body is waking you up naturally, due to caffeine, exercise, moving around in general, etc! Now your brain needs to process the adrenaline, and that is processed through a small section on your brain. it has a few settings, but unfortunately it has a primal scared shitless setting it accidentally sets off. So what is happening when you are panicking? : you most likely feel tightness in your chest, you start to sweat, your body wants to run, or hide, or be close with someone. (You can also have different symptoms, which is totally normal!) think of it as you are a surfer bro, and this totally radical wave picks up! But you underestimated its size and now are stuck. The wave will start to rise, just like your panic does. Then it will die down, and potentially rise up again. The important part to note is: you WILL reach the shore. So what are you going to do during a panic attack? How do you help ride out the wave? My advice would to be patient, and figure out what works best for you. Take slow, even breaths. Shock your body by putting something cold on it, or go for a run. You can also do jumping jacks, turn on music, dance and sing. You can get into odd positions, make fun noises/words you wouldn‚Äôt usually do. The goal is to basically tell your mind there is nothing to actually be afraid of! Slowly it will understand that there is no danger present, even though you‚Äôre scared in the moment. Your brain and you are one in the same: figuring out the world, and how to deal with it together. But you are NOT your panic! You may not feel entirely in control and rational (that‚Äôs because the frontal lobe isn‚Äôt as active during a panic attack, so critical thinking and rational thought is more difficult!) and that‚Äôs perfectly fine. So you now have reached the shoreline, but what are we going to do about all the water that‚Äôs still clinging to you? Well think of your panic as a rave, and now all the lights have been shut off, and the music stopped. Your adrenaline is having a hard time figuring out where to go after the party! Now the idea is to redirect the adrenaline, and that can be difficult as well. Workout, exercise, find soothing tasks for your mind like puzzles or watching videos that interest you. You could also play video games, or talk to loved ones about what happened. You might get frustrated with your lingering emotions, and that‚Äôs totally normal! If you need to scream, scream. If you need to cry, cry! Let your body do what it needs to do in order to feel safe again. (I know this is super long winded, but I‚Äôm almost done, promise!) so now you‚Äôre out of this mindset hopefully, and we can start to address what you feel afterwards. It may seem hollow, but you are not subhuman whatsoever for having a natural, human response. Most people will get panic attacks once or twice in their lives. Some may experience more. What you just did was stand up to millions of years of evolution, designed for you to run for your life, to survive. And you won! Even if it doesn‚Äôt feel like you were brave, you were. Even if you didn‚Äôt want to BE brave, you were! Now it‚Äôs important to reach out to medical professionals to understand your mind more, and how to handle and limit future panic attacks. Plenty of people do it, and it‚Äôs nothing to be ashamed of whatsoever. There is also r/panicattack which you can visit, and find people going through your situation. Panic cannot kill you or harm you in any way. Your brain may think up some scenario on what will kill you. it‚Äôs important to remember that it‚Äôs not being malicious, but grasping at straws in an attempt to understand why it‚Äôs panicking. I really hope that this has helped you in some way! Feel free to ask questions, and remember you are not your panic! You got this, and it will pass. ü©∑",Barneyboy3,2

Do you know what's the most common thing on the minds of first-year students? Probably nearly 80% of our clientele in August/September tells us that they want to make more friends but they feel like other people either already have friend groups or it's as if they are way better at it than themselves. As someone going into their 5th year of university, I can tell you that 90% of the student population in most colleges have no fucking clue what they're doing. If they seem to be a natural at making friends, they're probably struggling with their classes. If they seem to be getting straight 90s all the time, they probably struggle with the social aspect of uni. I guess my point is that all those people around you that seem to have everything in order are not as ""put together"" as they seem on the outside. Have confidence and enjoy the new experiences!

The right approach is to embrace the uncertainty and that way slowly become comfortable with it. Try telling yourself how there's a chance you're not good enough and it's okay if you're not. Same with if you made the right decision. Accept maybe you didn't, but it's okay.",AntonioVivaldi7,4

i am asking for anyone's honest opinion about why others may do this, or if this is just social anxiety. i don't know, and i have my first therapy session next Wednesday, and i do not want to sound dumb to my therapist. anything helps, and if you read this far, thank you",More-Ad-2731,3

But working on not cheating myself that way) and 2) break tasks down into smaller, easier things. Bathroom needs cleaning? Do smaller parts as a full job ie, Spray and wipe the mirror.

2023-11-14 02:17:37,reddit_comment,"Going to take a different approach than everyone else who says to delete it as, if you‚Äôre like me, I never stay away for long. Some things that are important to keep in mind when using social media: those titles are made that way on purpose because it illicits a strong emotional response and subsequently a click or at the very least it gets your attention. Hopefully you can get some comfort knowing you are absolutely not alone in how anxious and upset it makes you feel seeing it. That‚Äôs the whole point of clickbait, to attract as many viewers as it can and fear/insecurity is an easy way to grab lots of peoples attention. 

Your algorithm can see what you click on and even when you stop scrolling to look at something. Because it‚Äôs purpose is to keep you on the site/app as long as possible it‚Äôll show you more of what you spend the most time looking at. That being said, it‚Äôs easy to end up with a feed that is mostly made up of emotionally charged, fear mongering content especially for people like us who are extra sensitive to stress and anxiety. We see titles like that and think, ‚Äúoh, what if that applies to me? Better take a closer look to see if it does‚Äù. It‚Äôs like a snake eating it‚Äôs own tail. We‚Äôre trying to help ourselves by being informed but in reality we‚Äôre feeding the anxiety more unnecessary things to be scared of and ultimately making ourselves more anxious. 

The best way to help yourself is to consciously avoid engaging with that content at all. If your algorithm sees those posts aren‚Äôt getting your attention anymore, it‚Äôll stop showing them and replace it with whatever you are engaging with. You will not miss it, believe me.

Lastly always take what people post with a grain of salt. Despite how they present themselves, they are just regular people like you and me. People generally don‚Äôt post anything other than what‚Äôs going well in their life. You have no idea what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes and I can guarantee it‚Äôs not as perfect as it looks. Also what they say might not always be true or applicable in your situation. Many are just regurgitating things they read or heard elsewhere or talking about their specific personal experiences. That‚Äôs not to say there‚Äôs no merit in what they‚Äôre presenting but you should always keep in mind they are ‚Äúcreating content‚Äù first and foremost. Being factually correct or helpful isn‚Äôt always their top priority.

Knowing these things and acting accordingly has really helped keep my feed less stressful and when it does get more stressful, I know how to deal with it :)",Schmittenwithart,3

2024-05-12 11:34:42,reddit_comment,"***""experience heavy anxiety every day""***   No expert , but that sounds like a high priority problem that needs to be solved asap and the first thing to tackle in all of this. What do you think about trying to develop a strong mind to help counter it?

**What exactly is a strong mind?** Imagine facing a medical crisis without a hint of panic, or encountering harsh criticism without feeling rattled. A strong mind means maintaining composure, staying cool, calm, and collected no matter what challenges you face. This unshakeable calm places you in the perfect position to choose the most effective response, attitude, or emotion suited to the situation at hand.

For many, this mental resilience is not just beneficial; it's transformative, serving as a formidable shield against anxiety and depression. Embrace the power of a strong mind‚Äîit's your ultimate tool for navigating life's ups and downs with grace and effectiveness. 

**How does one achieve a strong mind?** Keep in mind different people may face the same problem but often require unique solutions. But one approach that has consistently worked for me comes from Marcus Aurelius, a philosopher and Roman Emperor. His strategy emphasizes that while you can't control external events or past actions, you can control your reactions and feelings to them. Here are a few transformative quotes from him:

1. ""The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts."" (control your thoughts to control your life)
2. ""You have the power over your mind -- not outside events. Realize this and you will find strength.""
3. ""Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option: To accept this event with humility; To treat this person as he should be treated; To approach this thought with care so that nothing irrational creeps in.""

Try applying this philosophy: When faced with a situation that triggers negative thoughts‚Äîperhaps someone treating you unfairly‚Äîpause. Instead of reacting with anxiety, negativity about yourself, choose how you want to feel. Maintain this chosen emotional state and then act from this place of control and competence. Remember, effective actions can vary‚Äîranging from diligent work, kindness, or doing nothing and patience to seeking advice or simply accepting there may be no perfect solution. Sometimes, you might find yourself at a dead end with no apparent way forward. In moments like these, your attitude is your greatest asset. Embrace a mindset of resilience and positivity, much like U.S. Marines who famously thrive under adversity by seeking  out and enjoying being miserable at all times, and at that end moment... they are loving it, just like they practiced. Give it a try. You might discover the power to shape your emotional landscape and tackle life's challenges more effectively.

I have done this 4 times in last 1 year and have lost nearly 25k of hard earned money accumulated over last many years. 

I have not really been stupid generally speaking. I rate reasonably well on IQ tests. I am in late 30s and I think the lack of career growth in comparison to what I wanted from myself has pushed me into a zone where I hastily take decisions because I feel everything in my life has stalled and I need to move fast otherwise I will remain a failure. As a result, I keep making mistakes over and over again while in pursuit of a successful outcome. Nothing gives me joy - I don't celebrate anything because I feel any positive event is just overdue and I move on to try and get the next event. At the same time, I keep getting into messes that I repent a lot lot about! So I am always sad due to either not moving forward in life or messing up my life.

When I see my classmates who are of same or young age who are doing better than me, I get anxious. This anxiety makes me want to escape the situation. My ego forces me to quit the things I am doing (such as my job) and make we wanna pick ‚Äòsomething with more meaning‚Äô as what I am doing is anyway not good enough. 
I was raised by overprotective parents. So now I am someone who is anxious and someone who wants to do something big in life to compensate this feeling of being behind. 
i am too scared to change the direction of my life because I fear that if I fail, I would be even more behind. I want everyday to be productive. Not that I haven‚Äôt achieved anything in life. But nothing is satisfactory enough. I try to hard to not waste a single day and here I am someone who has wasted almost a decade of my prime years. 
I know that I could not ever become great in a corporate and always wanted to have my own thing but fomo and low self confidence made me choose the easier path which I dread almost daily.
Despite being serious with my life I haven‚Äôt gone anywhere.
Some keywords that can define me: anxious, low self esteem and low self confidence, ego, someone who procrastinate, loose, indecisive, always blaming others. 

Because of the nature, I am always tensed and anxious in office and life in general. Even a week feels like a month. I switched my previous job without reading my current job profile as I just wanted an out. I sold myself by saying I wanted to explore and see other side of the business and this role is not just even worse but my manager is also very timid in nature who doesn‚Äôt have guts. I feel trapped under the management and feels like I am wasting my potential. 

At this point I don‚Äôt even want an another job, I just want to bet on myself and start something of my own but too scared because of lack of vision and low confidence. 

How can I get out this vicious cycle of negativity

Also, I was seeing a therapist but she was not much of help. 

Edit: one more thing I want to add, I am very much attached to my parents and seeing them getting older also makes me worry. I feel that instead of spending good times with them, all I do is cry. I am an adult crybaby. ",blackmamba1028,3

I‚Äôm okay for a while, but I quickly run out of energy and need hours away from the group to recharge.

I was on a trip for school in my 30s (went back to finish degree), and went on a required school trip just a quick 1.5 hour plane ride away. I was gone for three days and spiked such a bad fever and then got so sick I had to fly home early.

On the flip side, I‚Äôve traveled with one or another family member to the other side of the world multiple times and been completely fine. I literally plan the entire trip and they‚Äôre running to keep up with me for the 6-8 miles we walk each day. I love traveling!

I‚Äôm invited to go on another girls trip and just the thought of going has caused me to completely crash.

2023-12-19 11:14:59,reddit_post,"Notification Anxiety Okay so I‚Äôm F20 and I‚Äôm going to start off by saying that I am not diagnosed with anxiety. I also don‚Äôt believe I have it but I‚Äôve been irrationally anxious lately and I need help until I find a good therapist.

This needs a little backstory.
When I was about 12 years old I got into a stupid fight with my 3 best friends at the time in a WhatsApp groupchat. One of them was orchestrating the whole thing which made them band up together and essentially bully me through text. They would continue where they left off with texting at school. I felt so powerless and heartbroken at the time and any attempt that I made to stand up for myself or explain anything was obliterated. This lasted for about 3 weeks which I don‚Äôt think is that long when you compare it to the damage that it did. I was terrified of the WhatsApp notification sound for a whole YEAR after that. Thankfully it dissipated and I honestly forgot about it.

Until 8 fucking years later.

Now I‚Äôve been part of a discord server for 3 years where I made extremely close friends. I actually met my now husband in there. Long story short, the server owner did something very disappointing regarding one of the members and it split the entire server in two. It‚Äôs unspoken but everyone took their side even though most people had no real info about it. 
This event happened a month ago and ever since then I‚Äôve been an anxious mess and I wasn‚Äôt even a part of the conflict. Not to mention very hurt by some peoples actions. I‚Äôve spoken out about my opinions and it offended some people. But I don‚Äôt want to be painted as someone I‚Äôm not because of that. There is so much gossip, shit talking, and passive aggressiveness happening in there as of now, mainly from the same people.
All the emotions of 12 year old me came flooding back. Now everytime I hear/see a Discord notification a have a mini adrenaline rush, my heart starts racing and my mind becomes overwhelmed with possibilities of people saying bad things about me. I always have to check my phone immediately to confirm/deny my irrational fear but it‚Äôs never the case. I thought I got over this already, but apparently I‚Äôve been traumatized pretty bad. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want this stupid dramatic bodily reaction to hinder me from talking to my friends or responding to people on time. I also don‚Äôt want to give the few bad apples in there so much power over me. Especially because my husband is there too and we always have fun in VC. I‚Äôve thought about distancing myself but that thought just makes me sad, I also have fomo. Part of me also thinks I need exposure therapy? I‚Äôm lost. Can someone offer advice?",-Aeen-,2

We're living in a time where it seems like we're doing everything to make ourselves okay, but are we really? From FOMO to the pressure of social media, we're caught in a cycle that's pushing us towards more and more non-ending cycle of anxiety.  
and how people are coping with that? Adderall, once reserved for specific conditions, is now a go-to for many trying to stay ahead in a hyper-competitive world (I've read that 3 out of 10 college student in the US are using Adderall). And caffeine - our everyday stimulant -, the stimulant we've normalized in our daily lives ... keeping us wired and alert, but at what cost?

2023-11-02 00:28:58,reddit_post,"I might lose a friend because of my anxiety I'm gonna try and keep it as short and concise as I can but this is a rather long story.

I met this friend (Y) in college last year, because we study in the same degree. We became close a month or two after we met. At the same time I started seeing a therapist for my anxiety which I had had since Covid.

Among many other things, my anxiety makes me very worried about my friendships. I always fear that my friends are gonna leave me brutally one day for no good reason, or that they pretend they like me when in reality they hate me... Classic anxiety shit basically.

Most of my friends know about this aspect, and especially Y. They told me they would be ready to be a shoulder I could cry on and a support for me when anxiety becomes too unbearable. I was so happy they told me that, because for me that meant we were close friends, and I could talk to them about problems that are specific to our degree, that my therapist sometimes can't fully grasp. Also, my closest friend, who I'm used to confide in, lives in another city and suffers from depression. Even if they are very available, I was glad I could take a little something off of their shoulders.

Anyway, Y and I enjoy our friendship without any issues for several months, even though we are two very different persons. They are an extrovert and a people pleaser with a very strong fomo, so they need to be with everyone all the time and always do something with other people. Sometimes it can make them unavailable, but I learnt how to deal with that with them and my therapist. It was going well until March 2023, which has been a true shit show for me. It started with the worst panic attack I ever experienced in my life, and a strong anxious episode of an entire week. On top of that, classes were becoming very demanding for me. So much that during the last week of March, I just couldn't show up to class anymore. I couldn't take a step out of my appartment without shaking and crying and wanting to throw up or pass out. I told everybody that needed to be told that was happening, my school, my therapist, my friends, including Y. Everyone was so nice to me during this week and the week after when I came back, checking on me, making sure I was okay, my school offered me some adaptations for classes that I agreed to take (and still benefit from today). Everyone except Y.

The day I came back to class, they didn't ask me how I was, they didn't even say hi to me, while sitting behind me for the whole day and talking non stop to my other friend who was sitting next to me. I tried to rationalize, I tried to tell myself it was just how Y was.  I told myself they were just busy with something else. But at the end of the day, after not having heard a single word from them, I was so angry and sad. I came back from what was basically a one week sick leave because of a mental health condition that Y was aware of, and they didn't even took time to ask me if I was doing okay, while other people who are not that close to me did ! I told them how I felt about the situation, how disappointed in them I was. They told me I was overreacting, that that's how they are, that they hadn't spoken to other friends of them in the day... I know too much reassurance is not good for anxiety, but that answer didn't satisfy me, and was so different from their usual behavior. For the first time I felt like I was a burden to them.

From then I decided to not consider Y as a support anymore. We were still friends, but they wouldn't hear from my anxiety anymore unless it went in the way of things we planned to do together. I went back to talk about anxiety only with my therapist and my closest friend. I told myself that Y offered me their help just because they felt like they had to, or they couldn't say no, while I stated multiple times that they could tell me if it was too much to handle.

The rest of the school year and the summer went rather fine for me. Things went south again at the beginning of the new school year. My anxiety was through the roof because I had to go back to my demanding degree, and I knew groups and classes were going to change and that I would not be with a lot of my friends in the same classes anymore. For someone with a lot of anxiety regarding friendships, that was a tough time. But I dealt with that alone with my therapist, because I knew Y wasn't available to talk about that.

At the beginning of the year Y asked me if they could park their car in the parking lot next to my building. I agreed, I was glad to do them a favor. And they told me they would pay up for it by spending time with me. In two months, we only went to a restaurant once. They don't eat lunch with me anymore, never come to say hi when they come parking their car by my building, barely speak to me when we see one another in the hallways or in big gatherings (which they know I don't like to go to). In a nutshell : I feel like Y doesn't give a shit about me anymore. In addition to this being one of my worst fear coming to life, I don't understand how we went from close friends to that.

Since I realized that, I'm just so miserable. I always feel angry and sad when I see Y or when their name is mentioned. They are the only person who put me in such a state, and I still haven't put my finger on the exact reason why. My other friends say I should put up with Y's behavior, because that's who they are, my therapist suggests I have a face to face discussion to tell them how I feel, and my closest friend tells me to go no contact with them. I'm contemplating the last option, because I'm fed up. I can't keep crying about someone who doesn't care about me, who doesn't see what state they put me in. I want to move on, especially since I met new people who seem to truly and genuinely care about me and my well being.

It's the first time that anxiety is the main cause of conflict between me and someone I love, which is why I am so upset. I know that friends come and go, that people getting apart with time is part of life. I already lost many friends, but not so brutally, and not in a way where I felt I was the cause of the friendship ending.

I don't know what I'm looking for with this post. Maybe I just need to vent, to get it out of my head. If you have advice, I'm open though. Maybe just a quick word for people who know anxious people : do not tell them you can help them if you don't have the time or energy to help. Anxiety is exhausting, irrational, fluctuating. No one, and certainly not anxious people, will blame you if you don't feel like you can handle it.

TL;dr : a friend of mine offered to help me with my anxiety a year ago, now we barely speak. That makes me miserable and I don't know what to do about it.",IntrovertFrench,3

2023-10-10 23:00:44,reddit_post,"Missing a work trip due to anxiety? So context:  I've had anxiety for many years, and the last few years it has been manageable, and relatively easy to do so. I had private EMDR and Hypnotherapy, which really helped me work through past trauma and tackle my depression and anxiety. Whilst going through this, I was taking the SSRI sertraline.

A couple of months ago, I made the big decision to finally come off of my meds, after being on them for years. I finally felt ready and equipped to handle my emotions. I came off of them in stages after talking with the doctor, and for the most part it was pretty pain free. However, I am now fully off them, and only now seeming to feel the withdrawal effects.

My anxiety has been through the roof, really difficult to control, and mood-swings between being sad and angry are an almost daily occurrence.

Last week, I flew to Dublin. I have always been a bit of an anxious flyer, however I can only describe flying to Dublin and back as feeling traumatic.

I'm from the UK, so a flight to Ireland is around 45 minutes. But I was so panicked and anxious. I even considered skipping my flight back home and diverting for a long ferry/train journey home, if it wasn't for the fact I had dogs I needed to be home in time for. For the few days in Dublin, I kept getting almost flashbacks to the flight, and how awful and scared I felt. Before the flight home, my stomach was in knots, and I thought I was going to v\*mit before boarding.

I'm due to fly this Thursday morning to Croatia for a paid company offsite trip with work. Please note this is a social trip, I'm not there for business.

I am now terrified to go, and have been battling for the last week with my inner narratives as to whether or not to go. The flight is almost 3 hours, and I barely tolerated 30 mins, I don't think I can do it. I'm around a lot of people I don't know, as my job role is WFH, which isn't helping. And the last few social work events I attended I felt like crap the whole time. My social anxiety is now in the ring.

The trip is also two nights away, and the itinerary is packed, and as someone with a short social battery, I feel like there won't be time to breathe. 

I don't want to miss the experience, but I don't think I can handle the flight and the social concerns at the moment. I'm trying to not let my anxiety stop me from experiencing life (which is something I'm keen to do, #Ô∏è‚É£ quarterlifecrisis) but I am dreading it. But in a way, I can't guarantee I'll enjoy myself either, considering how I feel at the moment.

To an extent, I'm dreading the comments of 'you're letting yourself down' or 'you would have had such a good time, youre missing out' or 'you can't beat anxiety from your safety zone'. But part of me thinks I just need to listen to my body at the moment, and be kind, and allow myself to not go and stay home.

I also want to note, I've spoke to my manager, who is so supportive of whatever I choose to do, and there is no immediate consequence if I don't go.

Small steps, but you definitely have to push yourself a little. Perhaps you have a close friend who knows your struggles, whom you feel comfortable with, who can go to the gym with you or join in on the other things. If not, all you can do is keep trying. If you go somewhere and get overwhelmed, take a moment or leave if you have to but don't let this keep you from doing it again. Every step counts and you need to remind yourself this. Be proud and celebrate all those little moments instead of focusing on the negatives. 

I'll tell you though, getting into weight training changed everything for me. Daily exercise can do wonders for those who struggle with anxiety and depression.

The negative thoughts will come, you just have to cut them off and replace them with positive ones. Sure, I only lasted 20 minuets in that store but that's better than no minutes!

Positive affirmation guided meditation is something I listen a lot to when going to bed. I like the long ones that continue to play even after I fall asleep as your subconscious mind is still listening.  

I have left notes around the house (mirrors, fridge etc) with positive quotes and affirmations to just keep reminding myself to stay positive.

2023-02-10 16:55:06,reddit_post,"Anxiety being in your bed, alone, in the dark üòì Sometimes I get this awful feeling being alone in bed, in the dark, in the middle of night, no noise but the A/C. I don't know why I hate that, but I just want to get up and do something, anything, grab my phone, turn the computer on, watch TV. Maybe I just don't want to be alone with my thoughts (a very scary proposition indeed). It's a real shitty feeling. On most nights, I have no problems what so ever, maybe I'll just sleep, or maybe I can't sleep on that night, but I won't have that anxious/scared feeling. Just depends on how the day went and if I have a lot of pent up anxiety I suppose. I hold onto a lot of anxiety throughout the day, even after the day is over, my jaw is still very tense, my chest is tight, and I think of things that happened during the day, grimacing.

There's also a hint of FOMO in there (fear of missing out) like I'm missing out on some fun somewhere, but that doesn't really make sense either as it's usual 1 or 2 AM (like now) and nothing is likely going on anyways. So the FOMO is kinda odd, but I definitely have that feeling.

Maybe it goes back to being told to go to bed as a child so I could be ready for school in the morning, and instead I desperately wanted to stay up and watch TV with my parents or play video games and have fun, having to go to bed felt like a punishment. I dunno, I don't need to psychoanalyze it I guess.

The Bed has unfortunately been a place of anxiety for me for much of my life. Your bed should be the opposite of that, a place to go relax and wind down, and get some much needed rest. Instead my heart starts racing sometimes when I lay down, or more often when I wake up in a panic for no real good reason an hour or so after falling a sleep.

 I sleep much better during the day for some reason, there's something about night time that's just too quiet and spooky perhaps, and if I sleep during the day I get to kinda hide from life as well.

Anyways...going to bed sucks! üò´ I wish it didn't. I never look forward to it, I'm always reluctant.

Sorry this is kinda all over the place, mainly just typing all of this out as therapy since I'm anxious at 2 AM and am exhausted but really don't want to go to bed and feel anxious. Already slept 1 hour and was anxious, then woke up in a panicked state (happens too often).

if you can relate to any of this, please chime in. I don't mind if no one replies, again, mainly just typing this out as therapy.",rubix44,10

So it may seem to be a very unnatural way to feel, since it's probably foul weather that causes anxiety in most of people who struggle with any kind of anxiety. But for me it's this beautiful, sunny weather that enhances my anxiety.

I'm rather an extroverted person who likes to be outside, around people, especially when the weather is nice and I could go outside for a nice walk. But the problem occurs, when I have things to do and got to stay at home. It feels like FOMO (is it one? ) but in real life. I got this feeling like I could do something nice, could meet someone awesome, something great could happen to me and things like those.

# 

The reality is it's all my fault and it's all because I didn't work hard when I had to . I kept obsessing over useless things and now I regret that heavily . I know that visiting doctor make me feel good because it gives me the feeling of being a victim and reassurance that it was not my fault but deep down I know that I am giving excuses and running constantly form my fears instead of facing them .

Throwback to my school life when I was a talented and all rounder kid with great grades in class and was great in extra curricular activities and sports etc . But in my school , there was never any event or fest so I never got a chance to express my talents , So I developed a habit of daydreaming where people appreciating me for my talent and I behave like It's happening in reality , unaware of the fact that this daydreaming habit will become so addictive and dominant that It will lead to serious consequences . Soon I started prioritizing daydreaming instead of going outside and really do something in real like joining an academy or learning new skills . Today I am so addicted to daydream that my focus is so poor that it lead me to a failure in academics and being completely lonely in real life as I don't go outside because of daydreaming habit .

When I see my peers doing good in their lives , It makes me feel regret , guilt , FOMO and self hatred . I avoid talking to the, , talking about them . meeting them because I become so anxious and start overthinking , I start having headaches and so tensed and frustrated . I have a feeling of jealousy , self hatred and anxiety constantly feeling like a failure .

I tried about multiple things to find out my interest but they all were temporary obsessions , nothing else . Also I never had a solid aim or goal . I never had an idea what to do in my life .

I am in the last year of college and in three years , I rarely went to college because it's in my local city and my old schoolmates come there and I feel ashamed to go there . I don't go outside of my house because of the same reason. All my friends went to different cities and are in good college .

I am really conscious about my physical appearance as I have body dysmorphia and Maladaptive daydreaming but I know these things would have never happened if I focused on something productive and having a GOAL in my life .

Every night I have a dream of these thoughts constantly reminding me of my mistakes and everyone else doing good in their lives . Every single night .

I try to cope instead of facing the reality . I know how shit I am addicted to PMO , junks , mobile phone , social media wasting my time . I hate myself . I really do .

I know going to doctor will change nothing But It gives me reassurance . I know that nothing going to be alright but still I try to cope form my reality via daydreaming .

I wish I worked in a better direction that wasting my time on useless things . Buried in guilt and regret . Having no interest in doing anything . I don't like waking up in the morning and going outside .

I know everything is an excuse now . I am such a coward person who has no courage to face his fears .

I really regret missing opportunities in my life .

2023-03-21 09:46:38,reddit_post,"Having anxiety and PTSD over being excluded from a reunion. Toxic ex-friend who socially traumatized me was invited.  **TL;DR: Having very mixed feelings over a reunion that I was not invited to but I feel I should have been, plus a former friend who socially traumatized me was invited**

Backstory: I am a pro player at a certain game. I went viral on YouTube and Reddit (different profile). The game's official YouTube channel's video of my gameplay has over 5M views and is the third most-viewed video on the channel. I had worked with the game's PR on stuff in the past and was always welcome at events and such.

I befriended many other players of this game over social media. I deactivated Facebook in early 2021 because I realized my mental health issues were showing and people were leaving group chats because of me and even unfriending me. I decided to deactivate before I ruined any friendships that meant a lot to me. I still maintain strong friendships with many of my fellow players.

For many years, the makers of the game said that they would never do a tournament or any kind of ""bring together the best players"" event because the player base is just too large and because the game is very luck-based (but if you're like me, you can sort of manipulate your odds). This year, a new person was put in charge of the game and they have decided to finally have a special event reuniting ""fan favorite"" players in person, most of whom went viral in the same way I did.

15 people were invited, and I was not one of them. The day the invitations went out, I got several messages from fellow players asking me, ""Did you get invited to the thing?"". Many in the community were shocked I was not, and one of them said ""They're missing out without you"". When I found out this was happening, I started trembling with anxiety for multiple reasons. One being that I was overthinking why I wasn't invited and paranoia that I may be blacklisted (I have been very vocal about the game's flaws on social media). One thing that got me was that around the time my gameplay was posted, I was often grouped with two other great players in promotional stuff and we were kind of like the de-facto ""GOAT trio""; we were the top three viewed videos on the YouTube channel at the time, though a couple have snuck between us since then. These two people were both invited to the reunion event. I am so happy for those who were invited and I'm trying to convince myself that not everyone could get this opportunity, but I can't help but feel hurt and worried.

The ""reunion"" happened today, and I purposefully avoided everyone's social media so I wouldn't have to see photos or anything of them hanging out at bars or restaurants and stuff afterwards. I suffer from FOMO big time. I've flown out to events that friends went to just to avoid FOMO, but I didn't have time to fly out for this reunion even to just stop by and say hi. The event is not being publicized until May, so I'm going to have to deal with this feeling again in a couple of months.

Part of the reason I am anxious about this whole thing is because one of the players who was invited to the reunion is a former close friend of mine. We bonded over the game of course, and his high score blew mine out of the water. We discovered we had a lot in common. He also suffers anxiety and he gave me advice on what meds are better than others; I still take the one he recommended me to this day. We're also both gay, and I found him very attractive (as did many others in our community). Our friendship shattered when I went to visit him in person (across the country) and he showed very manipulative behavior that I was too naive to discern at the time. He purposefully distanced himself from me whenever we were in a room together (e.g. sitting on a different couch) and excluded me from ""parties"" he went to while I was in town to prevent anything sexual happening between us, and lying about them. He had been sending me several pictures of him shirtless and in bed with other guys we knew, knowing it would turn me on, among many other forms of leading me on, but never had the courage to say ""I don't like you like that"". Instead, he let me come all this way and then gaslit me for trying to come on to him, saying it was inappropriate behavior (behavior that he exhibited with other guys right in front of me, and said ""It's different with them"" when I asked). We tried to move on from that experience while staying friends, but then he kept making jokes about me with the other guys and I got tired of it. We haven't spoken in months, and when we did speak, it was only because he had a question about the game.

I suffered so much social trauma from this person I trusted, and his group of friends who seemed like a Mean Girls Plastics clique that acted polite around me but I later realized they didn't care about me one way or the other. I followed all of them on Instagram and only one followed me back. These people ostracized and humiliated me on top of my friend's various forms of mental and emotional abuse. The trauma only started setting in as months passed and I started crying myself to sleep and sort of ""reenacting"" the day everything happened in my head wishing I was more assertive. Now I get PTSD at the mention of his name, and I deleted almost every picture I took on my trip to meet him. So since he was invited to the reunion, I might have declined if I was invited so I wouldn't have to be in the same room as him, because it would have been so triggering for me and I would not have been able to concentrate on the game. That being said, I would definitely be willing to take a day to have a serious discussion with this person over how he made me feel and maybe we could start over strictly as friends, because I do think he is a good person.

I really hope come May when the reunion is made public that I don't suffer any more PTSD. I hope I can find some healthy distractions.

2022-08-04 23:42:58,reddit_post,"My first year at uni has ruined me I‚Äôm not really quite sure where to start. I‚Äôm 21, female and from England. I moved to a different city 4 hours away from my hometown to study last September.
I‚Äôm quite outgoing, confident and self assured and would say that I was already quite mature and content before I left uni. I was happy within myself and was so hopeful and optimistic that my university experience would be full of opportunity and newness. 
I‚Äôm very close to my single mother and moving away was extremely hard. It was great in the beginning when I was navigating through my new city, filled with new people and it was, to me, a honeymoon stage because it didn‚Äôt last for too long. I was eating well everyday, looking after myself physically - but now the years over, I am mentally burnt out. 

I didn‚Äôt have the greatest time with friends even though I‚Äôm incredibly social. I didn‚Äôt realise the majority of people just wanted to drink and do drugs and go clubbing most of the time. I didn‚Äôt find ‚Äòmy‚Äô people, and instead found people that loved to put me down despite how unproblematic I am. I lived with 7 other girls in uni halls and it was the worst. What helped me was my incredible lecturers, the support I had from them helped me so much. 

I spent my whole year, everyday picking myself up if I felt sad or anxious. My FOMO didn‚Äôt help either, I‚Äôve been waiting to go to university for a very long time and the build up of expectations also led to my demise. My mum would come and stay with me for a week at a time every other month when she realised I wasn‚Äôt okay. 
Somehow I managed to pass all of my exams and my year, which I didn‚Äôt think I could do with how low I felt and how constantly ill I was getting, probs due to stress. 
My whole year I was surrounded by toxic, and negative people - who mostly dropped out towards the end anyway because they were so unserious. My coursemates are all toxic and treat the degree like it‚Äôs a competition.
I‚Äôve come back home for summer feeling broken, feeling like I‚Äôm not who I was anymore. I feel numb, and I feel empty - I feel like nothing excites me anymore and I feel burnt out. I think my stress levels were so high this past year that my body physically can‚Äôt handle it because for the first time in my life, my face has broken out in painful eczema that won‚Äôt go away. Which doesn‚Äôt help how I‚Äôm feeling because now im back home, I just want to go out and about and distract myself from my year. 
I want to share a lot but I don‚Äôt want this post to be too long - but I do feel like, my year moving out to uni traumatised me. 
I had covid for a month in January and had never felt so alone and by myself. Trying to manage food and looking after myself was so difficult that I ended up becoming so ill, paramedics had to take me to the hospital. I had no one around me that truly cared, and it was the most isolating experience I‚Äôve ever had. There‚Äôs a feeling I can‚Äôt shake from spending my year alone trying to navigate my world, and then the feeling of living on campus which made me feel suffocated. The food shops every week, the workload of my course, the urge to experience life in this new city and do everything I could to do it etc etc.  I think my year would‚Äôve been the complete opposite if I didn‚Äôt live in halls, or if I had a good, consistent group of people around me. I don‚Äôt drink or smoke, and I‚Äôm not the type of person whose interested in short term relationships or flings, at heart I do feel a lot older and just crave peace. I know next year all I want to do is study, go gym and eat and sleep well and have a part time job. I really want to use these few years at uni to build a life for myself, I just don‚Äôt know where I went wrong, because whose to blame other than me.

Despite that, on the upside - I have a nice house next year which isn‚Äôt uni accommodation with two lovely girls, one who I‚Äôve known all year. So I can‚Äôt complain about that, and my new neighbourhood is incredible. It won‚Äôt have that suffocating, uni student feel. It‚Äôs nice to be around families and kids, or older people.  I just want to heal from my past experience so I can enjoy my new chapter and hopefully a better year. 

I guess I just want some advice to heal and cope now, and to help my body mentally and physically heal. I went into uni happy, and bubbly, no self esteem issues and incredible confidence and good health. But this whole time, it‚Äôs been slowly chipping away and I‚Äôm not kind to myself one bit. I don‚Äôt feel like me, and I don‚Äôt know how to go about feeling like there‚Äôs a light at the end of the tunnel. Even though I passed my year and I‚Äôm proud of myself, I don‚Äôt even feel any sort of way about it. I know all of how I‚Äôm feeling is perspective and mindset, I just don‚Äôt know what I need. I do have the desire to change and work on myself to get better, if anyone has anything I could learn from to help me, I really will listen - I‚Äôm desperate. 

I have big goals after uni. To become an optometrist, and buy a home for me and my mum. I spent a few years working super hard to have saved a small deposit on a place for us both. I have a lot going for me and I‚Äôm grateful for all of my opportunities, but most of the time I just feel like I‚Äôm wasted potential but don‚Äôt know how to go about it. I constantly beat myself up and pick on myself. I sometimes wonder how I will ever be good enough for the world around me.

I also have soo many plans for the future which keeps me optimistic but most days I go to bed sad, feeling as though my life right now isn't what I want it to be. However, it's good to tell yourself to stop looking ahead in life, because life isn't about the past or future it's about right now. (I hope that made sense) I think something you should work on is doing something for yourself everyday. For example, I started doing yoga! It's actually very relaxing and really good for your body! I also joined some kickboxing classes, pole classes, painting classes, etc. They're something fun that I look forward too every week and it's a great way to meet people! Have you looked into therapy?

With that said, you seem to be a very strong & capable person to overcome all this hardship, pass your year & still come back, learning from what happened last year. I'm certain your second year will be much better living with your friends. I'd find some new activity groups through the uni or your friends if you can. Can be anything, the point of it is to meet new people & try new things, so think outside the box!

Lastly, stick to your plan. Get that job, study & go to the gym. I think it's wonderful you're looking to take care of your mum, very very few people think like that nowadays. Build yourself up, don't put yourself down, you are more than good enough.",JForDucksSake,2

2022-11-25 21:21:24,reddit_post,"Developed some kind of anxiety this year - tips to manage? I am a single 33 yo man, and was always a combination of impulsive, overthinker, procrastinator. I suspect having mild ADHD though it is not really recognized for adults in my country. But I only tended to be anxious in short bursts, and never felt it was a problem.

This year was a roller coaster, it started when I got laid off from my job of over 4 years, which was pretty chill though I was slightly underpaid. Strangely I gained a boost of motivation from it, kicked ass at interviews and got several offers. I got greedy and accepted two, one as full time and negotiated part time on the other. My total compensation more than doubled.

It turned out to be hell. The main job was a very complex project and I felt pretty isolated, and not getting enough assistance. The part time one I could handle but they were very pushy with deadlines they invented all the time. I didn't have any real vacation days this year, when I took days off at full time job I had to catch up on the part time one. The weekends never felt free since I was always kind of catching up on the part time job. I started getting anxious, like I am always behind on debt payments or something. I started therapy, which strangely didn't help with the anxiety of the job, but I did become less impulsive and a bit more organized, and started working out regularly again.

About a month ago I left the part time job after a disagreement with the boss, and it became even worse since the full time job was much harder and less organized. I started interviewing for something more chill and out of nowhere I got an offer from a friends company, but I had to start right now part time, and switch to full time after my notice period. The money is really good so I accepted. Currently I am struggling with it.

The anxiety is getting worse and worse, to the point that I wake up desperate. I am hypersensitive to everything, getting unreasonably nervous over small things that don't go my way. I don't have any desire to socialize outside my small friend circle, and I am overeating. I quit caffeine and felt a bit better, but the procrastination got worse so I am back on it again. I self medicate with small doses of benzos, which I know is wrong but it helps drive off despair.

I have enough to take a break but I also have a huge FOMO for the money I am missing out on...

I'm new here...

I am a member of the local photography club.  While I regularly enter my photos online into the monthly competitions, I have not physically been to a meeting or awards ceremony since 2019. Mainly due to feeling extremely awkward and not being able to socialize properly, add this the fact that I have gained a heck of a lot of weight in the past few years and am extremely self-conscious of this fact.

This year, I have done particularly well in the monthly club submissions as well as inter-club competitions, even having won best image overall. The chairperson messaged me imploring me to please attend the awards ceremony as she has seen the results and thinks I really need to be there(like really need to be there) - as she put it.

I usually don't hesitate just skip gatherings and events like these but now my fomo is kicking in.  I'm really excited to find out how I did but also soooo nervous and anxious to actually attend the ceremony, I super scared to have to go up and accept the awards.

2022-10-06 09:21:02,reddit_post,"FOGMO People have told me I have FOMO. When I looked it up, a definition that came up (from https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-cope-with-fomo-4174664) says:
The fear of missing out¬†refers to the feeling or perception that others are having more fun, living better lives, or experiencing better things than you are. It involves a deep sense of envy and affects self-esteem. It is often exacerbated by social media sites like Instagram and Facebook.

So upon reflection, I don't get FOMO (not discounting those who do) but I do tend to fixate on the things I do miss out on, for example not being able to attend a friend's wedding due to work, not being present for the last session of a group activity and then missing the group photo, or not thinking of something in time then missing it as it was too late when it occurred to me etc etc. So I guess I am genuinely missing out on those things because I could have in a slightly different scenario been there or done those things (very different from, say, wishing I were wealthy and travelling the world).

2022-08-17 06:48:57,reddit_post,"Concerts and crowds - anxiety thoughts Hello,
I never liked going to big concerts or shows and I always thought that it's because it's just a thing I don't enjoy. Now I am thinking that it could be (in part) connected to my anxiety.

In the past months, most of my friends are at festivals and big concerts from artists I love and I keep seeing their posts all over social media.
My reaction is: ""well I like the artist, but how in the world is that enjoyable?? Just a bunch of people standing and singing out of tune.""

Is there some FOMO involded in my reaction? Sure. But even when i stop and think about it, I know that I would not like to be in their place at the concert.

Observing my reactions I had an epiphany that I am not afraid of big crowds because they make me claustrophobic (which i always thought is the reason ppl feel anxious in crowds), but that I simply cannot enjoy something if there are people around me. 

From my past experience, at a concert (even a smaller one) I can't relax, I have no idea what to do with my hands, how to stand or what to do. Suddenly I am overthinking and standing awkwardly, waiting for a show to pass. I don't like to sing, dance or just sway to the beat of the music. Because of that I generally just observe people, something I like to do in general, but then, I get this crushing anxious feeling that I am staring too much and I am the weird one. (Which is bold of me to assume, because in a bigger crowd, probably no one really looks at me)
I just cringe at other people dancing and singing. I wish I didn't feel like that, because those people are having fun and it's just me reacting to them, because I can't be like them.

Ugh, I feel like my mind is connecting the dots, but I am not quite there on how I feel about concerts. It may be a combination of anxiety and just me not liking those kinds of concerts. (If I may add, I am a classical musician, so I guess my profession also plays a role in my perception of it. I also do enjoy casual classical concerts outside of concert halls A LOT. But that's because no one dances, you just sit and listen.)


What are your experiences and do you have any thoughts on this?

Why do you like/dislike crowds?

How do you feel about concerts?

Do you feel like an alien because of your hobbies/things you like to do? 

How do I discern if I really don't like something or if it's just my anxiety telling me I don't like it?",hoopsechord,3
2022-08-17 13:16:37,reddit_comment,"I hope my experience might shed some light or help you out. I recently went to a concert a few months ago. Normally I don't do those things because concerts are loud, there are lots of people and sometimes they can get out of hand. However, I really love this band and wanted to go. (it did help that I got my mom to come). I have gotten older as well and have found ways to help my anxiety. 

What helped me was to focus on how cool it will be to see my favorite band play live. I also made sure to bring my earplugs for the noise and my pepper spray for security/feeling safe. 

I do remember waiting in my seat, being worried people would judge me for my outfit or the way I stood, danced or even sang along. What helped me was to focus on the songs as they played and eventually I got lost in it all and had a great time. I have also noticed that as I've become older the better I am at managing my anxiety. 

>Do you feel like an alien because of your hobbies/things you like to do? 
 
Well, yes, even going to this concert. I felt weird and alienated, but maybe that was just me and my anxiety. My need for approval from others and a desire to fit in. Despite the hundreds of people lined up to go inside, I still felt like I was out of place and that liking this band was weird and dumb. 


>. I don't like to sing, dance or just sway to the beat of the music. Because of that I generally just observe people, something I like to do in general, but then, I get this crushing anxious feeling that I am staring too much and I am the weird one.

I would say that you are not alone in this. I've been to two concerts now. The first one was more low-key, just me, my also shy friend and my brother. My friend just sat there enjoying the music, no one else seemed to even notice. I eventually forgot that she was doing that until I looked at her again. The most recent concert I went to I had this guy about my age next to me, just stand there not reacting much too. Maybe he had anxiety too, but no one pointed it out. I only noticed because I was next to him, but I soon forgot about him as the concert went on.

What I have learned is that most everyone is so self absorbed in themselves and how they are perceived by others they hardly notice what others are doing or how they are acting.",Humanoid_Lifeform10,1
2022-09-06 12:18:01,reddit_post,"How to mitigate anxiety originating from multiple sources I \[28m\] recently have realized I have terrible anxiety.

Some of the primary anxiety sources for me are:

* Losing my job and being unable to find a new job in time and experiencing a financial crisis
* Aging and decaying and someone close to me dying
* FOMO and missing out on fun experiences as I get older
* Fear of becoming a co-dependent in my friendships/relationship dynamics

Today, I had a terrible hangover, which made me feel really anxious and jittery. I invited my family over for Labor day and I cooked them food. This event made me EXTREMELY anxious to the point that I'm sitting here crying after they left.

The thought of going back to work tomorrow with all the shit piling up is also giving me the heebie-jeebies.

Any advice on what to do? Weed definitely helps me mitigate this, but I feel like I'm forming a codependent relationship with it because when I'm sober, my anxiety gets horrible. Finding a good IRL therapist is also another anxiety inducing thing.",Gordon101,1
2022-06-24 02:12:29,reddit_post,"I wish my anxiety would let me handle backlash normally, including when using this app. This is probably the 5th time I‚Äôve reinstalled this app after having another fit of panic, and I won't be shocked in the slightest if there's more to come.

I both love and hate Reddit; I love¬†it because there‚Äôs a community for everything and because of how easy it is to see and meet like-minded people; I hate it because, for some strange reason, this app *specifically* makes my anxiety increase tenfold, especially with rejection.

For example, yesterday I made a post on r/rant about people pooping in public pools and how disgusting it is‚Äîsilly, I know‚Äîbecause I don't know about you guys, but it's personally happened way too many times to me, after I saw a video on TikTok about the same thing and felt compelled to write about it. Just posting on an unfamiliar subreddit made nervous pangs sprout throughout my body, but I was really intentionally dramatic and used a lot of alliteration and stupid phrases in the post just so people didn't think I was *too* heated, so I thought it‚Äôd be fine; I was expecting a few people to see it, comment about how nasty that is or their own experiences, because comments are my favorite part of Reddit when they don't make me want to implode on myself, and that'd be it.

Maybe people on there are really skeptical (God knows why anyone would lie about someone crapping in a pool, but okay), but despite how simple my rant was, I had people saying I was lying and that it was some ""creative writing assignment, and not a very good one,"" and, again, for the thousandth time, I started panicking over a stupid post that got some backlash. I don't know why people were so quick to doubt it;¬†even amidst the panicking, deleting, shortness of breath, and rapid heartbeat, I knew that, but just those what? Two comments and downvotes on my post and upvotes on theirs felt like a tsunami of hatred. Just that rejection was complete hell, and I was sitting there, feeling like I was about to explode as nervous sweat rolled down my back and my chest threatened to burst.

I hate how bad it feels, especially because Reddit doesn't have a ‚Äòdelete inbox notifications‚Äô option, so I end up making a new post to cover up the comments taunting me, only for that post to meet the same fate. I feel like a complete nuisance and unwelcome in a place where people don't even *know* or care about who I am. It's completely irrational, but I still deleted this app only to reinstall it a day later because it's the one place where I can kill time without having to think of how pathetic I am, and the FOMO of not having it just makes me panic even more.

I can't even use this app right, and the irrational fear of people recognizing me from that post makes me want to crawl into a pit and die. It's not even their fault; it's not a crime to doubt something, but no matter how little it is, it feels like a swarm of hatred and rejection.

Maybe it's because of the way I worded it or because I was too comical with it. I don't know what‚Äôs wrong with me and why, no matter what, I always end up ruining things for myself. Their words just keep replaying in my head on loop, and the only way I could distract myself from that and the incessant pains in my heart last night was to force myself to go to sleep, but now that I'm kind of refreshed, though every day I feel like that shit, I don't know what to do. Uninstalling this app for good and pretending it never happened isn't even an option, because it's just a constant push and pull that won't end. It's not even that serious, but it keeps plaguing me.¬†",cockrobotcock,2

2. Stay home, let my boyfriend go with his family and I go to the pool and swim all day and maybe get some reading in.

-If you want a more eventful life, then you need the money and resources anyway which sucks for most people who can barely think for themselves 

-The predisposed idea that with age comes great sacrifices(needing to grow by the pace society wants you to, rather than your very own)

And last but not least

-The fetishization of ""change"" and ""progress"" when the reality is most change is an illusion, most change  is hyped up and is not benefiting humanity or even the rest of the living world long term


I don't know what do you guys think?


Also 

The idea that most things in life are temporary and the so called ""once in a lifetime"" opportunities don't help either 


And then there's this imminent fear I have that the outside world is becoming obsolete, due to the recent influx in technology, globalization, gentrification, infrastructure and comfort+instant gratification, which adds fuel to this ''time-based"" anxiety of mine

How about focusing on your core values (what's truly important to you)? Acting in alignment with those core values strengthens our perceived self-worth and confidence, which in turn leads to more stable/coherent emotional feedback and a calmer mind. 

So a first step into building your mental health and perceived quality of life could be to define what's truly important to you. You could make a list of values, like health, fitness, creativity, family, friendship, romance, sexuality, nature, success, financial security, fairness, peace, honesty and so on.

After writing down ~ 20 values (at most) which you believe to be important to you at this point in time, it's best to compile a ""top 5"" list to see where most of your focus and thus your energy goes to. It's usually the top five that you really need to take care of, since those will be your ""core values"" at this point in time.

You can do so by taking one of those 20 values you wrote down earlier, writing it on a blank piece of paper to then compare it to the others on the list, by questioning yourself ""is value X or Y more important to me right now?"". Just go down the list one by one until you find a value that tops the one you initially wrote down. This value replaces the other one as the new top value. Now you start again and do the comparison until you find one value that tops all others. This is your current number one value. Now you do the comparison again (without the top value of course) to find your number two, three and so on, until you got your top five settled.

The next step would be to set clear rules of behavior for each value. You define how you want to act within the frame of that certain value and apply the same standards for the behavior of others towards you (if others are involved, like with sexuality or romance). You communicate these standards towards yourself by writing them down where you can access them regularly and hold yourself accountable by tracking your progress through journaling for example. You communicate them to your surroundings through your own actions and by setting boundaries and informing others of your expectations towards their behavior as clearly as possible. If others are unwilling to act within the boundaries you set, make it clear to them that you won't compromise on certain things. Fuzzy communication only leads to conflict later.

The more we act on our values and in alignment with the rules we set for ourselves, the more we will be living life as a ""creator"", defining ourselves through our values and the actions we perform to breathe life into them, instead of longing for a state of being.

This sounds pretty easy when pressed into a few paragraphs. It's pretty hard to actually do though, since most of us compromise on our needs and values at times in favor of other gains or in an attempt to avoid certain scenarios. Doing so every now and then isn't the end of the world but doing so regularly takes a huge toll on our mental health and is one of the major contributors to mental health struggles like depression or anxiety.",Christian_Asemann,2

It's been really useful for me so far, and already, I feel a little better emotionally and mentally.

There‚Äôs been an announcement here that by summer, things should be largely back to normal. I‚Äôm absolutely terrified, it‚Äôs making me completely panic just thinking about it. Since I left high school, I‚Äôve never had loads of friends. I have a boyfriend and a couple of really close girl friends who I absolutely bare my soul to. I met my boyfriend in a little gap between lockdowns last autumn and since then we have spent so much time together. It‚Äôs worked well for me because I have spent lots of time alone and with my boyfriend which I enjoy and have had an excuse not to be out socialising when I don‚Äôt have lots of people to socialise with. 

I feel like I‚Äôm going to have intense FOMO when the lockdown is over because I don‚Äôt have a load of friends to be going out to the pub with.

2015-07-15 09:22:59,reddit_post,"Feeling old at 18, please help I was always the child that didn't want to grow up. As young as 11 I remember wishing I was not so old, it felt like my childhood passed so quickly and then it was gone.


Now at 18 I have a crushing feeling of impending age. I know I'm quite young in the eyes of most people but I'm horrified at the thought of getting even a single day older. Living past 30 doesn't seem worth it to me, and I know it will come so quickly. What is there to look forward to? Getting older doesn't have any upsides besides the 'responsibility' and 'freedom' that are always thrown out there. You are far less free to do what you wish as an adult than you ever were as a child. You must be tied to a job, a life, a set of choices you cannot go back on. I see this coming from a long way off and feel powerless to stop it. It terrifies me. I do not want the responsibility and endlessly closing doors. The slow physical decline and the loss of many things and people that cannot be replaced. I do not want the monotony of a life that I can feel ending every minute.


I am not afraid of dying. If I had a sudden fatal accident tomorrow I would not care, the dead don't feel. I am afraid of the inevitable progression of time. It feels stupid to ask for reassurance, like I'm looking for delusion, but I haven't been able to shake this feeling for a long time. I already felt too old seven years ago, in a blink of time it will be ten more years and there is nothing I can do to stop it. No amount of foresight will save me. I need a different perspective or I feel like this is going to lead to me killing myself just to avoid a long boring life. ",-VII,28

2015-07-15 14:13:42,reddit_comment,"Do you have the FOMO (fear of missing out)? Do you feel like you didn't get to fully experience your childhood, or do you just wish you could have stayed?

I had major FOMO... and based on my past, my therapist called my childhood itself a loss. I always considered myself younger than what I was... I had a hard time remembering my age, and would a sting in my chest whilst correcting myself (example that's actually happened: How old are you? Me: sixteen - wait, no, I'm... 18... I'm 18...). I couldn't imagine myself being happy at 30. I don't want kids (made that decision around 10yrs old when I became an aunt) and it's a pretty shitty feeling when you're apathetically taking a psych class and all of a sudden everyone has opinions about how selfish someone must be to not want kids, what's the point if you're not gonna have family to grow old around, blah blah (I never said my decision, the topic came up on its own and I felt far too misunderstood to see a benefit in trying to speak up). This was during a time where I felt pointless, and I preferred the idea of cancer or other illness than to getting older and playing house alone with a 9-5 job and no friends because they all got married and had kids and I'm the freak that didn't want that. (notice how I gave myself an ultimatum... not healthy thinking AT ALL)

Now at 24... I still feel a little younger, I still don't want kids - but I do feel better about the future. Maybe it had to do with dealing with young/immature people in various situations... I didn't realize how old I was until I was reminding myself of the ""everything sounds like shit"" episode of South Park... but on the other hand, at least I can confidently feel like I've gained some wisdom/experience in the last 6 years. I finally found a career direction (which high school really does NOT prepare you for by the way) and I feel confident about it being able to keep my interest enough to not have completely miserable jobs for the rest of my life. This and hobbies. Friends and new friends. 

Therapy did help give me some sense of control in my life... getting older is a fact, but being miserable about it is a choice. Life is fluid, not every decision made after 18 is going to permanently affect your happiness. You're still allowed to change your mind; you can still say ""lol yup I fucked up"" and tack it on as another lesson learned. Any age. Don't work toward things just because you feel you're supposed to... jump through your own hoops, not society's. Figure out what you need to make YOU happy, and work hard to figure out your path to get there. Afraid of slow physical decline? Start taking care of yourself NOW - do you even lift? Sound like you could use the endorphin-boost anyway. Have you seen those older fitness trainers all over instagram and whatnot? Excellent examples of older people kicking ass and being happy and probably have complete flexibility with their work schedule too. 

Also, you are much more free as an adult than a child: I can eat ice cream for breakfast, go where I please, use internets however much I want (or is this something children automatically get now?). Nothing is really yours as a child, you get what you're given. It's actually nice to be able to own things and know that you can do what you want with what's yours without anyone else's judgement interfering with your decisions. 

Okay this ended up being all over the place, sorry. Point is, I know it feels like this is a shitty way to live and it's the only option you've got, but really it isn't that bad and your options are damn near endless as long as you don't kill yourself. If your mind won't let you enjoy the journey, you'll be miserable at every stop you make. A therapist can offer a more consistent and positive mindset to challenge yours with, and I hope you consider this option. ",microbitch,1

I really don't want it to come to killing myself, I thought about it a lot in the past but it's just not logical with where I am now.

I do still tend to feel a lil younger than I am but my musculoskeletal issues, the grey streak in my bangs (which I LOVE btw), and Gen Z entering the workforce are consistent reminders lol.

 Nowadays I experience less FOMO and more JOMO (joy of missing out). In 2019 I moved into my own place solo - then the pandemic hit - and I realized I'm a lot more introverted than I thought I was. I love living alone, totally amplifies all the ""I can do whatever I want"" energy I felt at 24. I've really gotten to know my demons, and also started to accept I'm likely neurodivergent. Making and maintaining friends has always been hard for me, so my ""friends and new friends"" line is kinda funny to me... I'm so protective of my energy now I'd definitely rather be alone than be around questionable people. It's weird looking back on how lonely I was as a kid, to now craving being alone if I've been socializing too long. ""Who has real friends at 35"" indeed! But honestly if you just do what makes you happy you'll encounter other people with similar interests. I think the key is to get to know/love yourself so you're not reliant on external validation. 

I still don't want kids and have also realized I don't especially want to get married - like if it happens then cool, but I really like having my own space and living with significant others hasn't worked out for me. This has lead me towards relationship anarchy and polyamory, which I don't have a shitton of expertise in, but it's nice to know there's other people out there rejecting the typical ""what you're supposed to do"" life path. If I end up an old crazy cat lady, so be it. I'd rather live my life for me (and my future cats). My friends that are married with kids are certainly more distant now, but also express that they like living life vicariously thru me (dating app stories, travel, generally more time and money for fun). 

I still enjoy my career but the business politics and capitalism of it all are big downers. It helps that most people in my generation see and hate it too tho. I still highly recommend therapy for everyone, altho being off and on over the years I've definitely learned that good mental healthcare is hard to come by.

And the fomo along with the immense amount of nothing I've been doing at home (my only creative outlet is gone too because my laptop is out for repair so I can't even draw to relieve myself) I feel like I suddenly have all this anxious and terrible energy, not the nice kind of energy that makes me want to clean or work, but the kind of energy that makes me cry when I walk into my room because its so messy, but I stand there spinning in circles physically unable to tidy any of it because its so overwhelming, I've spent the last few days on the brink of a panic attack but never having one. I just don't know what to do, can anyone help or share some grounding tips? Is this even a common occurance or am I really just hypersensitive and overreacting :(",soberanoid,11

I understand FOMO but true friends will understand and you will have plenty of time to create new memories with them. 

I listen to music when my mind and body won‚Äôt quiet down. Sometimes I listen to stuff and have a good cry just to expel some feelings and it can be cathartic.

It‚Äôs my last year and I just want to do everything, cheer at football games and pep rally‚Äôs, play powderpuff, go to homecoming and prom, freely be myself around my crush. It‚Äôs hard, I‚Äôve been going through with it but it‚Äôs so taxing, and isn‚Äôt even fun.

You might need to figure out what coping strategies can help you be more present and less anxious. You can start by looking into deep breathing exercises on YouTube. Practice deep breathing right before an event, deep breathe if you find yourself getting anxious during the event, and then again afterwards. Pay attention to how your body responds - you might realize that you‚Äôre forgetting or picking your skin or tense. You‚Äôll want to relax your body. The focus is to just accept what you‚Äôre feeling, change what you can, and remember to focus on your breath so your body can feel more regulated.",hello0722,2

*Hey there,*

***Hope you are all doing okay.*** 

I am currently working on finishing my BSW degree, I have 1 more class (taking one class next semester and then I am done).

Recently, I have had to start working to have money to help out with house expenses. I live at home with my dad. 

 I don't need to work much, only about 15 hours a week- but for some reason, my performance anxiety when it comes to going to work has become ridiculous. I just got a job as a host for a pretty busy restaurant where I am from. I have always had better bad anxiety, but not with work or school. It is like I cannot shut my brain off from thinking about it. I have never had issues attending classes or working before the last 6 months, but it has gotten much worse. I am having trouble being around large groups of people, I have absolutely drained afterward and have to recover all the way until my next shift. I should also mention I was recently diagnosed with RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis), which may be contributing to my fatigue, but the anxiety is from when I wake up until I get to work, then I feel better.  I also started to feel an extreme feeling of FOMO when I am there, and like I am wasting my life/time with family to be there.

I am hoping once I am finally done with school, I find a remote position. Any advice in the meantime to help with this extreme anxiety before work? I anticipate it and obsess over a pretty easy hosting position that is only 15 hours a week...

Thank you..",littlescardycatmex,2

i (20f) have been with my partner for a year and a half and every so often i get quite overwhelming intrusive thoughts about my relationship, especially about if i am a cheater and if i wanna be with other people, and this often leads onto thoughts about being poly, which i really don't want. whenever i do have these thoughts they make me feel awful and like im an awful person too

i don't think i am poly because i am a very jealous person, and i don't want my partner to be with other people, but then this just leads onto me thinking that maybe im just an awful selfish person.
whenever my friends talk about online dating i kinda miss that and want to do it too but i don't know if this is just fomo and wanting to have more friends

2020-10-20 22:08:45,reddit_comment,"You said it yourself, it‚Äôs intrusive thoughts, and you clearly don‚Äôt want to cheat or be in a polyamorous relationship. Start from there. When these thoughts pop up, don‚Äôt even try to fight them. Everyone gets irrational thoughts, just like everyone has thought about being with another person. The issue begins when you obsess over certain thoughts. You‚Äôre giving these thoughts meaning. Just because you have a thought, does not mean it‚Äôs a legitimate thought or deserves your attention.

There‚Äôs something called ‚Äúthought-action fusion.‚Äù This is when you equate a thought with the action itself. So when you think about cheating on your partner, you equate the thought with the action of cheating. Your anxiety is reacting as if you‚Äôve actually cheated, but in reality it‚Äôs just a thought. You‚Äôve done nothing wrong!

As hard as it is to tolerate, just try to remind yourself that thoughts don‚Äôt mean anything, they aren‚Äôt tangible (they literally do not exist outside your mind). These thoughts do not dictate who you are as a person. So you‚Äôre not a terrible person. On the contrary, your overall concern over this shows that you‚Äôre not. You clearly care a lot about your partner.

My takeaway is this: thoughts do not equal actions. Your thoughts do not reflect who you are. Try to accept these thoughts and they will eventually go away (there‚Äôs literally no way to disprove these thoughts, which your anxiety is encouraging you to do).

It also may be worthwhile researching ‚Äúrelationship OCD‚Äù which focuses on this exact type of obsession. And more than that, it shows that you‚Äôre definitely not the only person to go through this and have thoughts like this. Good luck to you!

My anxiety is selfish. Trust me, I know the way it likes to make things about itself. Trust me, it told me so. I know the way it likes to slip this way and that, the way it slumbers all the time while it oozes into dinner conversation and shifts the mood. I‚Äôm already thinking up the apology text I‚Äôll send you later. At the same time, I already know I won‚Äôt read your response. I‚Äôll tell you I was tired. I was stressed and stretched thin, more than I realized. I didn‚Äôt mean to be so negative and self-absorbed. 

Even though you didn‚Äôt think I was listening, I‚Äôll tell you my thoughts on everything you were saying. I know I am not the only person with a lot on their plate. I‚Äôm sorry if it seems like I already had my fill, I just haven‚Äôt eaten in days. And I‚Äôm hungry and scared and I‚Äôm grasping at empty air most times so when I see you I am desperate for any scrap of normalcy I can get. ‚ÄúPlease please please hear me out and let me relate and let me try to process anyone‚Äôs problems but my own. Mine are too big and I am too small. And I can only process so much. But I‚Äôm drowning your thoughts in my own while mine are already drowned by me swallowing yours.‚Äù

Deep breath. Forget about that, it was nothing. 

That‚Äôs when my anxiety makes my stomach hurt with self-imposed guilt and distorted memories that are the wrong color. Memories that I share with others, only mine come with annotated, highlighted split-moments of me fiercely blushing, moments that others have long forgot. That‚Äôs when my anxiety likes to remind me that maybe, and I emphasize maybe, they remember.

My selfish anxiety is the sound of my ringtone. The notification of another missed call and an unheard voicemail. Every time it rings and bings and dings it somehow gets louder and harder to ignore. It‚Äôs the same sound of my heartbeat. Can everyone hear that too?

Missed spam calls bringing me missed voicemails so now I‚Äôm missing them all. And it‚Äôs all because I‚Äôm anxious about what I missed. Talk about the ultimate FOMO. 
 
It‚Äôs funny though. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm selfish. I overthink and I oversleep or don‚Äôt ever sleep but it‚Äôs not because it‚Äôs in my best interest. I‚Äôll find myself in any horoscope you say is mine. I‚Äôll even give you a good reason why. My anxiety disrupts my daydreams.

Basically, on Friday (10/1) the college I go to is holding a concert on one of the football fields as a result of at least 90% of the student body being vaccinated against COVID. I do want to go, but there‚Äôs a few factors that are messing with my decision-making skills right now:

-The crowd will likely be 80-85% of the student body, meaning about 3,000+ people. I don‚Äôt do well in large crowds; a concert I went to before COVID was probably 1,000+ people and I ended up having a panic attack, but the venue was indoors and likely more ‚Äúshoulder-to-shoulder‚Äù than this concert will be.

-I really don‚Äôt want to see people making out or doing whatever else, I get that people want to have fun but I‚Äôd really prefer if they leave the PDA at home because it really makes me uncomfortable and queasy.

-FOMO. I don‚Äôt want to be sitting in my dorm while the concert is going on and seeing everyone‚Äôs Snapchat/Instagram stories filled with everyone having a blast. I especially feel pressured to go to the concert because of this, but in theory I wouldn‚Äôt mind going because the person who‚Äôs apparently performing has some good music that I could vibe to.

-I‚Äôm not really worried about COVID; everyone has to get tested 2 times per week. My college is probably one of the more stricter schools in terms of COVID.

I probably will end up going, so I guess my question is, how do I deal with these things while I‚Äôm there? Any advice is appreciated. :)

2021-09-05 21:26:07,reddit_post,"I feel anxious by not learning French. As you can infer from my profile and post history, I‚Äôm a language learner trying to master 3 languages. I‚Äôm not in this for fun or just to prepare for some 3-day trip, I actually want to be really f****** good  at all 3 languages. I‚Äôve decided to dedicate my life to this labour (sounds cult-like, I know, but I really feel a strong sense of passion for what I‚Äôm doing) (that is, I don‚Äôt aspire to be the idiots who claim to speak 20 languages but can only utter a few simple words and phrases). And after that, maybe I‚Äôll learn a couple more- French or Russian perhaps?

It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm terrible at them: for Spanish, I‚Äôve reached a pretty good level- for those who know the CEFR scale, it‚Äôs around the C1 level, while for Italian and Portuguese, I do have an intermediate level when it comes to writing and listening and reading comprehension, but I struggle with speaking at times. 

However, I feel a little (actually, very) FOMO because I‚Äôm not learning French I‚Äôve explored a little French culture (I love the few songs I‚Äôve listened to). I don‚Äôt care that everyone is learning French apart from me- that‚Äôs besides the point. For me, the interest is there- just that, in the quest to be near-perfect in all 3 of my current languages, it‚Äôs difficult to fit in another language (imagine remembering 20+ words from 4 languages everyday+ media immersion). This is not a question of goals either (I am learning languages for the sole purpose of learning the language- anything else is a result of that).

The Francophone world also seems so huge- I‚Äôm missing out on so much culture, media, literature. It sucks. I thumbed through Le Figaro (France‚Äôs national newspaper) and I see all this content that I‚Äôm never going to be able to access.

My routine (so you understand why I feel this way- it‚Äôs hard to squeeze in another language this way, isn‚Äôt it? ): I go all-out to study and try my very best at all 3 languages. I read multiple newspapers from 4-5 different countries EVERYDAY, listen to podcasts in each language, write at least a 200-word essay EVERY SINGLE DAY ( in BOTH Italian and Portuguese, the weaker languages), and try to squeeze in a couple of hours of speaking practise, if time and energy level permits. I‚Äôve essentially transformed my routine into one reminiscent of a military base/camp, no frills with a lot of drills- at least for now.

*I don‚Äôt learn languages to stop halfway- that is to say, I‚Äôm not willing to learn any language just to learn basic phrases, words and grammar- If I‚Äôm learning, I‚Äôm learning all the way and for life. 

** If you say- why not just watch X movie with subs or read X book in English- my response is: I treat this like a game- that is to say, everything is locked and I can‚Äôt access it until I LEARN the language. Besides, dubbing and subs and translations suck.

**Possible trigger for hoarding**



So... I know my anxiety has led me to be a big time collector of things. I enjoy collecting, but when I get stressed out I shop to try and make myself feel better. I *know* this isn't good, and have been working on it.  My mother was a hoarder and I know I have the emotional hoarder tendency if left unchecked. My wife has been amazing and patient about it and helping me fend off the impulses.

Over the past year or two, I have been able to let go of a bunch of things that I bought to finish sets, things that I only got as completer pieces. That's all a bit WIP and I'm getting there with some of the things I collect. I've been able to cut down the things that I don't have an emotional attachment to and reclaim a lot of my space. Hundreds/thousands of dollars back and some collections are down to 25% of what I had, only keeping the major ones I wanted to keep. (Some things like Pops doubled/tripled in value so I could sell them on eBay)

But... I hit a snag trying to go through my Disney trading pin collections and deciding what to keep and what to put in a trade pile. I know I have a few categories that know matter what, I want to keep, but then when I start looking at the others I get cold feet. Trying to decide where to draw the line makes me anxious of letting go of something that I'll regret letting go of, and I get nowhere. 

I keep feeling like, ""Ok, today is the day. I'm gonna make the decision"", then when I start I keep thinking, ""What if I decide to make this a primary set later?"", or ""What if this one gets to be valuable later?""

I've tried telling myself, ""I'll try to keep to X many categories"", and then almost immediately find that I can't do it. I know I have to pick but I just can't bring myself to let go.

I need to cut down what I continue to collect for my sanity, not to mention my poor wallet. I need to reduce what sets I'm looking for so I can focus on the ones I like most, but my FOMO keeps tethering me back down. I feel like a dragon refusing to part with a single gem or coin.

To make it even worse, I keep chickening out on interacting on the trading groups here on Reddit and other places. Every time I try to sit down and decide who goes on the trading board, I get overwhelmed and give up. Ironically it's easier for me in person, especially in the parks. I can march up to the cast members who are trading with barely any hesitation but a Reddit post? Panic inducing.

I have this weird aversion to drugs and alcohol and as a 22 year old who has close friends who partake in both of those, it is a very frustrating anxiety to deal with. I drink alcohol, i've gotten drunk many times with friends and found it super fun so I am very confused as to why I get so angry when I find my friends getting drunk, or more specifically my boyfriend getting drunk, without me there. Maybe it's the fomo? But it's less of a feeling of ""god I wish I was there"" (ok, it's a little bit of that) but it's more like...my mind has been suddenly possessed by a middle-aged mother from the '50s. I get intense anxiety know my bf is drinking with friends, he has a friend visiting that is staying over for a while and it seems like they're getting drunk like every day. My mind is immediately full of thoughts that sound so mother-like, for example stuff like ""he's drunk again? what is he an alcoholic now?"" or ""he doesn't drink this much when we hang out, is he friend making him do this?"" ""his friend is a bad influence"". I have NO good reason to think these things, but no matter how hard I try to push those thoughts away they're always there, and it flares up my anxiety. If the middle-aged ghost possessing me thought alcohol was bad, don't even get me started on drugs. Weed gives me 100x more anxiety and anger than alcohol does, and I hate that it does. When I find out my friends are smoking weed, I feel so angry and judgmental towards them (it's all internal, I never say anything to them about it). I feel like they've changed, like they're completely different people, how dare they be 22 year olds smoking weed in their rooms. I ger extremely uncomfortable when my bf jokes about starting weed, he had an edible a few weeks ago and my anxiety went through the roof. I felt..betrayed? Like I didn't know him anymore? I know these thoughts are so ridiculous, they don't feel like my thoughts. I would LOVE to feel like a normal 22 year old who is completely fine with people my age smoking and drinking, I had no idea why I was feeling so strongly against these acts. Then I realized...my parents. These thoughts aren't mine, i've been listening to my parents talk SO negatively about these acts since I was a kid. I internationalized their anxiety and intense negative emotions, i'm pretty sure the reason why I have an anxiety in the first place is because I learned it from them. I want to stop judging my friends for acting like normal young adults, I want to feel like a normal young adult.  I don't think i'll try weed, but I don't want to hate my friends for doing it. I also don't want to feel the usual intense guilt and shame when having a single thought about possibly trying an edible. I guess the advice i'm looking for is, how have you guys found ways to overcome opinions and anxiety your parents built into you. I know the answer is probably really simple like "" just think differently"", but the idea of changing my views on something like this scares the hell out of me, it gives me so much anxiety and feelings of shame. I want to change so badly tho",punkfr0g,2
2021-01-08 15:53:45,reddit_comment,"I think one step toward resolving your anxiety and negative emotions concerning alcohol and drugs is to explore why you have them.

It seems that you believe all of these thoughts and feelings come from your parents and keep you from being ""normal,"" which is definitely possible. However, I think it's worth exploring more because thoughts like ""is my boyfriend an alcoholic"" when he's drinking very often or every day is a rational/normal thought. Just because partying is often associated with people in their early 20s, it doesn't mean that they can't have concerning behaviors regarding alcohol and drugs. Unless I misunderstood, I'm hesitant to dimiss all of your thoughts as anxiety without more context because it's possible that you're picking up on signs of heavy alcohol or drug use that aren't necessarily normal or healthy for people, even in their 20s. 

Either way, it sounds like you want to get rid of the judgemental thoughts and negative feelings that you have towards friends who drink/use drugs. Right now, you're unhappy with the judgemental/strongly negative feelings towards alcohol and drug use that your parents instilled in you, so it might be helpful to clarify your personal beliefs. Does alcohol/drug use inherently make someone a ""bad"" person? Why or why not? At what point does it become unhealthy or personally unacceptable? When, if ever, do I want to drink/take edibles? Why do people use drugs/alcohol? What does it really say about them? 

I think taking the time to research and answer quesions like these can help you become more aware of your own thoughts and feelings towards alcohol and drug use and replace the ones you were given by default. You can continue to test any feelings you aren't sure of by diving deeper into your reasons behind them. 

You also mentioned some curiosity about trying weed even though you didn't think you ever smoke it. In case it's helpful to know, I wanted to mention that weed/edibles can cause intense anxiety/panic attacks in people predisposed to them. Also, if you take an edible, those feelings can last for a couple hours. Obviously, most people are able to smoke weed/eat edibles and have an enjoyable experience, but I thought it might be worth knowing as someone with anxiety.",deleted,1
2021-01-09 08:36:52,reddit_comment,"thank you for taking the time to write out all this wonderful advice!! The first paragraph makes sense and helped take some shame off of the anxieties I was having towards my bf and friend's alcohol and drug use. Maybe I should talk to him about him getting drunk almost every day, it could be he's just excited to get drunk with a friend he hasn't seen in a long time so I wouldn't want to come off as the Fun Police by addressing it. Better safe than sorry tho, I guess? As far as my friends go, my one does have an extremely unhealthy addiction to weed so my feelings of anger and anxiety are understandable there. That still doesn't explain why I get angry towards my other friends when they smoke weed normally, they barely do it but I still get mad over any mention of them doing it. Maybe my anxiety can be tied into a fear of them getting addicted to it but they can do whatever they want, who am I to act like their mother and tell them what to do? Maybe it can be tied into the fact that i'm a huge people pleaser, I feel other's safety, emotions, and happiness are my responsibility. Maybe if I see a friend or loved one doing anything remotely dangerous I feel intense anxiety over it because I can't control the choices they make, and if my brain thinks i'm responsible for keeping everyone in my life safe and happy then that's when it sounds the alarm. I feel maybe the judgement I feel towards people in my life drinking alcohol or taking drugs could be my parents' influence, but maybe the anxiety I feel is due to everything else I just mentioned. I'm learning a lot about myself right now lmao thank you, your reply actually helped A LOT",punkfr0g,1
2021-01-10 00:48:09,reddit_comment,"Of course--I'm glad to hear that it helped.

There's no shame in talking to your boyfriend about his drinking everyday. A conversation is simply a means to gain more understanding--you're not indicting his character. You're simply getting the information you need to either alleviate your concerns or act on them. If your boyfriend accuses you of ""fun policing"" for opening up a discussion, it's a sign that he's not very considerate or supportive of your feelings, which may be a red flag. Your feelings are always worth exploring and should be treated that way by a partner when you bring them up in an open and considerate way. 

As for your concern about your friends smoking weed, it seems like you may be on your way to figuring that out yourself. It's entirely plausible that, like you said, you react the way you do because your parents taught you that drugs are bad and you see friends that you care about using them, which is worsened by the fact that you can't stop them. 

This is where really exploring how you feel about weed may be able to help. Do you think weed is that good or bad? Why or why not? In what situations is it okay? What are signs that it's use is becoming a problem? 

Right now, it sounds like there's possibly a lot of uncertainty surrounding weed use, which means that, in your mind, it's possible that a friend may be in danger. However, if you come to the conclusion from your research that it's not that big of a deal in moderation and not likely to result in addiction, you'll likely experience less anxiety when you see a friend use it.

I would like to again mention that, without  knowing the specific context, it's possible that you are hanging out with some people who abuse weed or alcohol, and your feelings of anxiety may be an indication that it's not a healthy crowd for you. I just want to bring this up because that was the case for me on several occasions. 

You also mentioned that you may feel intense anxiety over loved ones making harmful decisions that you have no control over. Since I also have experience with this, I just wanted to say that it's much healthier in life if you learn to not put too much responsibility on yourself. I'm not saying to not care or to not try to help others, but that placing the responsibility on yourself to save others from their own choices will leave you exhausted and disappointed. Even if we know what's going to be better for someone in the long-term, the most we can do is communicate that to the person in a supportive and open way. At the end of the day, though, we can't control the lives of others or make people change more than they want to. 

Anyways, you sound like a very self-aware, intuitive, and caring person. If you keep exploring your feelings like you have been and looking for understanding, you'll have so much figured out at a much younger age than most people do.",deleted,1
2021-06-21 02:44:11,reddit_post,"I think I'm in crisis Throwaway account, I hope it allows me to post because I can't really take it any more and I really think I need help but I have no idea how to get it. I've been trying to deal with this for at least a couple weeks now, but the last few days it's spiraled totally out of control.

I'm 99% sure that I have OCD (based on reading, the ""pure O"" all inside my head mental compulsion kind). I think I've had it since I was a teenager, so at least 20 years but I didn't realize it was a form of OCD. It's always been pretty annoying and intrusive, but I hid it well and managed to live with it as part of who I am.

Recently I think I pushed myself over the edge though and also probably triggered a latent gambling addiction in myself.

It's over the dumbest thing in the world and I have no right to really be upset about it, but basically I got sucked into the whole ""meme stock"" thing. I'll spare the details, but all together I've thrown away probably $200k. Luckily it wasn't technically losing money but more like not taking gains when I had the chance and watching them wither away.

The reason this is destroying me so badly is because I was in a spot where I thought I might be able to quit my job and retire and just finally relax, but now because of the unrelenting anxiety and stress I've caused myself I absolutely cannot focus on work or really anything else in my life. I feel like a failure. It's like that ""other"" life I could have had if I did things right has become a preoccupation and I feel like I'm grieving over bungling it while many others became millionaires.

It's not that I made the wrong bet or got caught up in FOMO or got scammed. Just the opposite...it's that for once in my life I got it REALLY REALLY right but then didn't take what was freely given to me by chance, so it was all meaningless. Imagine you bought multiple winning lottery tickets worth $20k-$50k+ each and just threw them all in the trash. That's basically what I did.

Now I'm terrified that I might lose the job I was so eager to be moving on from. It's all compounded by the fact that I've always been a \*\*very\*\* disciplined and cautious person especially with money. Seeing myself as this person who can't make rational decisions or take multiple once in a lifetime miracles that come their way has completely shattered my psyche and sense of self and worth. I'm having a very very hard time forgiving myself for basically squandering what \*could have\* been the most insanely blessed year of my family's life.

And now...I can't turn it off. I've tried everything: exercise, pacing, replaying events in my mind (BAD idea!!), meditation, deep breathing, hot baths and showers, calming tea, scented oils, calming music, writing, even CBD tincture. Anything that helps is only temporary and it's only a matter of time before the terrible thoughts and terror and OCD either jerk me awake every couple hours or send me spiraling into what I think must be panic attacks. I haven't slept or eaten well in weeks.

I'm really scared it's never going to stop and this is part of who I am now. I can't stand that this is now part of my life's story when it could have been written so differently. I don't think I'm having suicidal thoughts, but I also feel like I just don't want to even be this version of me.

I worry I have become a crazy person...I get up to get water and then end up pacing back and forth for up to an hour muttering to myself, replaying events I've replayed dozens of times before, obsessively trying to imagine ""how I should have done it"" or trying to rationalize why I did what I did or figure out what I can learn from it. But in the end the thought always comes back: you can't undo it, you can't get the money back, you threw away an amazing year, you're going to get fired, and your life while not ruined per se is irrevocably diverted from how amazing it \*could have\* been.

I work in an industry prone to ageism and ""burn out"" -- the reason I want to quit is because I just can't imagine doing it for even another year let alone 5+ (assuming I don't get aged out). I know...boo hoo...but it's similar to being an athlete. You can't play football for 40 years...you have to make money as quick as you can before they throw you out because eventually that career isn't a viable option anymore. But I don't know what I do if I don't do this. I worry I'll burn through savings and end up homeless, yet the thought of being engaged doing my job when I could have just been done \*\*now\*\* seems impossible.

I feel like this thing will live inside my head for the rest of my life and it's branded on me like some kind of mark of shame that will haunt me forever, even if I'm the only one who can see it.

I think I'll always have this regret and that's bad enough, but now I'm terrified of the impact it's having on me and how I'm acting. I don't recognize myself, the OCD feels out of control, I'm having panic attacks and I wonder if this is just how things are going to be from now on...how do you live a life where you're randomly melting down every couple hours?

I'm scared of calling any hotlines or going to any clinics. I don't feel like just talking to somebody about it will help. I don't want to be diagnosed as a crazy person or get put in a gown locked in a ward, I couldn't deal with the shame of that, I don't want my family or friends to see me like that. I don't want to be a charity case. I wish there was just a magic wand or pill to make the thoughts and panic go away so I could sleep and experience some relief and find a way to move on with my life.",crisithrowaway_1234,1

I hate feeling everything. I'm just so sensitive that I swear everything is a trigger these days. I'm 20, a college student and have some history of childhood trauma so unfortunately there are a lot of stressors in my life at any given time. Anyways, my first meltdown this week was because I got stressed about a completely optional writing project. And I got triggered again today because I got fomo after my friend told me about her traveling plans. She was excited to tell me and I should be excited for her too but instead, it completely ruined my day. A lot of my social interactions end up like that too, so it's getting hard to catch a break.

I just get so anxious at times that all I can really do is cry. And this always lasts all day because I think it eventually mixes in with depression. I suddenly don't care about anyone or anything. And honestly the worst part is that I wish it would stay that way. I wish I could go on with my life without caring and overthinking so much. It eats me alive, so being depressed almost gives me a little break. Like I wish I could just disassociate for a few days because I know another meltdown is coming. At this point I'll do anything for relief and I guess depression is somehow providing that for me right now.

2021-01-28 09:34:29,reddit_comment,"As someone who does dissociate for hours and days and often feels numb, I can understand why you want a break, but trust me when I say ""careful for what you wish for."" I used to wish I could just go numb and my wish was granted (well, my wish had always been granted I just was blind to it.) And it sucks, cause the problem is you don't just go numb when you need to, you also go numb when you don't want to be numb, and then after dealing with it so long it's like ""What's wrong with me, why can't I feel anything, am I a psychopath, a sociopath, why, why can't I care.""

I like to think of it as a scale one side is feeling too much and one side is feeling nothing, you don't want the feeling nothing side you want something in the middle a healthy balance. And how to get that is through therapy and healing. As someone else with childhood trauma, I feel ya, damn I do, it's hell and there's no escape you just have to deal with it, cause that's all you're physically and emotionally able to do.  I can't say much to help, but I can say, it's a long road to recovery, but even the small things can help hugely, so maybe you can find ways to calm yourself down when it all becomes too much, like breathing exercises or learning how to deal with your anxiety, and learning how to battle that anxiety and even if you can't make yourself feel 100% better, at least try to feel just ok. Remember to give yourself breaks, and sit with yourself and deal with internal problems and all the healing stuff, just looking up videos on YouTube or websites to see ways to cope, cause not every coping mechanism is gonna work, you gotta done what works for you.",--Lost-Soul--,1

Now, my mood swings pretty dramatically everyday so I'm very much feeling everything now. It feels like I'm going crazy, but maybe you're right.

Over the past year, the group isn't as tight, naturally, and people have started hanging out more 1 on 1. Totally understandable. My closest friend in the group and I had a falling out, which I know was the best thing for me because she was being controlling while also withdrawing from me and it was making me act needy and I was losing sight of myself so that I could make sure we were ""good"" all the tine.  ANYWAYS, I am now realizing that some of my other friends from this group are not as close of friends as I once thought. Many of them never reach out to me and I'm the one always reaching out to them. I've decided to try to make new friends so that less pressure is on these older friendships. Bumble BFF has helped a lot! But I still feel crappy about my other friendships dying out, especially bc I see things on social media that give me FOMO.

I think that I had this expectation that my life would be like Friends -- like a super tight knit group of people -- and now I'm realizing that I might be a person who has just a few closer friends and the rest are just fun to hang out with casually every once in a while.  Rationally, I'm fine with that, but then I see on instagrams that friends are hanging out without me and that makes me feel like shit (and rationally I know that my friends don't have to invite me to every single thing).

Does anyone else think about similar things? Not even sure if this all makes sense. I just want to be comfortable with where I am with my friendships and right now I feel very vulnerable and shitty.

Does anyone else ever get anxiety over spending time on their own? It becomes a feeling of guilt that I have nothing better to do/no one else to see so I feel anxious about spending time alone.

2020-05-11 12:53:15,reddit_post,"Does reddit give anyone else here anxiety? Or Linkedin, or any other form of social media nowadays. Honestly scrolling through all the subs I've subscribed to and seeing people work on stuff that I have been meaning to do but haven't had the time to, or seeing other people make progress while I'm relatively stagnant has been giving me a lot of anxiety lately.

Add to that the mentality of making every single piece of news or information a huge deal which I think reddit does, i.e. overreacting to **everything.**

And then there's the COVID hysteria too. As if we need a constant reminder despite being quarantined at home.

Thinking of taking some time off but then theres constant FOMO because of the subs I actually enjoy visiting consistently",ppir,1

You should do a cleaning of reddit, follow things you like and get your mind off of things and get rid of all the news things and all the ones that make you anxious. Instagram I use a lot actually but it‚Äôs only because I made a whole new page and only followed accounts I was interested in.

I often get invited to things...dinner, parties, drinks, etc.  I tried it a few times, gave it a whirl, and nope, still not my thing.

I don't have to be invited...I don't feel left out, I don't have FOMO.  I only wanna do what I can do and that's ok with me and my family.  So, how do you politely decline?  Do you tell the truth?  How does that go over?  Do you make something up?  Not a huge fan of lying but I'm not sure the anxious introvert is overly understood or accepted.

Yeah, I run into jerks occasionally. But they've been the minority by far, and I'm usually glad to know they're jerks so I can ignore them.

Part of it may be the *way* I say it. I just make it a statement, no waffling, either prefaced by or followed by a shrug and a ""sorry"". Casual, relaxed, and friendly.

I'm gonna miss my dog, my cat, my husband (who starts his new job following Monday), my mom, my sister, my desk, my bed lol. But seriously I know I have to work, I went to school just for this. I have bills to pay, I want things, yesterday I was so ecstatic over just getting hired, today it's set in and now it's the whole ""I'm going to miss my life of just sitting at home"" which I've done nearly all my life. I'm 36 and the only job I've had in my entire life was between Oct 2014 and Mar 2016. I liked it, it was hard, luckily this job I just got will be different way different and harder, but so much easier. I hate people and working in retail you get all kinds of assholes. Working for a county gov they can be upset, but nothing like threatening someone with bodily harm over something so trivial.

How do you get over the crap, I'm going to miss out on things. I have that whole FOMO...Fear of Missing Out. I don't go anywhere, I don't have friends well just a couple, I stay in my office 8 hours a day, piddling around, I eat and go watch tv, So it's not like I'm actually missing out on anything. But at any time I can grab my dog and go lay on the bed. He's my non-official support dog. He's a chihuahua named Laces. He has anger issues so he'd never be a real support dog. 

I'm still super excited about the job. I've been tested on the systems so I know what I'll be doing to start with. First week going to be super simple just getting to know people, filling out all paper work, getting fingerprinted, getting my badge and then traveling to other sites with supervisor to meet everyone so they can get to know me.

2019-03-26 10:17:56,reddit_comment,"I'm so sorry you are going through this. It took me several years to meet the guy that is now my husband. That waiting period was the worst, especially when social media is rubbing your face in it and everyone around you is getting married. When I was going to college almost everyone I knew got engaged then or soon after, meanwhile I wasn't dating anyone. 

Now, even though I'm married, it's like a repeat of the FOMO pressure because my best friend is about to have her first baby, and others I know have already had babies too. I found out that I couldn't have a baby due to health issues so that makes it even worse.

I would definitely recommend staying off social media as much as possible if it is reminding you of all the engagements, weddings, babies, etc. There is no need to torture yourself. 

It also is completely ok to not be ok. That was actually a topic that came up in my counceling appointment today. Going through a wide range of emotions is just part of being human. I know it's hard, but try to cut yourself some slack as much as possible. 

Also, whenever possible, find hobbies and other things you love that can recharge you. This is not a magic trick to get a husband, as some people tend to advise. But it is important to take care of you, regardless of your circumstances, because you are worth it! This is a skill that I've oddly started learning more after marriage but I wish I could have learned it sooner. Be yourself, no matter what stage of life you are in, and I assure you that you'll be much happier. Do what you love, even if it's not for your official job. Nowadays  it's hard to have a career and your passions line up, but that doesn't mean you can't do what you love during your time off.

I saw this post were someone wrote about their anxiety and it felt really good knowing someone else is struggeling with the same thing. That im not alone. And then I found a lot of helpful tips in the comments. So im writing this post about my anxiety for the same reason.

I have this fear that I will become irrelevant to my friends. And as a result I have developed a hard case of FOMO (Fear of missing out). When I am home alone im always thinking about what others are doing. Im so afraid that I will miss out on to many good experiences that bring my friends closer togheter and leaves me on the outside.
I have problems making plans because im afraid that my main friend group is gonna do something fun while im doing something else.
I can't shake the feeling that my friends prefer it when im not there.

I have bad traits like everyone, mine is talking to much about my own interests, oversharing and taking up to much space. I have really worked on these issues, and becoming a lot better at it. Something my friends have complimented me on.
I have ofc talked about my anxiety with my friends, and they have made it clear that its all in my head and that they love me. They even make an effort to calm me at parties and such, telling me they appreciate me, and that they really care and love me. These moments are very beautiful, but I still go home from the party feeling like I made everyone like me a little less everytime.

I always feel like I have done something wrong, and overthink peoples reactions. If someone is quiet, I fill up with anxiety thinking I did something wrong.

I stopped drinking alcohol, because then I feel more in control of my behavior and have less anxiety the next day.
I also cut social media so that I dont see pictures and mystories of my friends. Even being able to see how long its been since someone was online can trigger my anxiety.
Both of these things has helped a bit. 

Anyone else struggeling with this?
Does anyone have any advice on how to overcome this, and what to do when anxiety hits?",vildeus,1
2020-05-26 06:41:24,reddit_post,"Anyone got advice for overcoming anxious/preoccupied attachment? Hi everyone! So here‚Äôs a short-ish autobiography to provide some context. During my mom‚Äôs pregnancy with me, my dad had an affair. After I was born, my dad came back, my grandma asked my mom to forgive him for my sake. I feel it would‚Äôve been better if they hadn‚Äôt gotten back together and I was just raised by my mom alone, but they got back together. My mom was actually the main breadwinner of the family, while my dad ‚Äústayed at home‚Äù and gambled and misspent our money.

It was a loveless union, there was so much arguing and fighting going on as I was growing up. I was a relatively carefree child, and was relatively pampered with material goods, but I didn‚Äôt get much attention from either parent. My dad wasn‚Äôt very affectionate, and my mom was busy working at our family-owned convenience store.But when I was 10, my dad had another affair, and it was a messy separation of him leaving, me going back and forth between my parents, him coming back, then ultimately leaving again. 

I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but I think this is when my attachment issues started. Something had changed. I felt more distant from my friends and classmates, and became more of a loner. I didn‚Äôt really have any close friends at this time. I was also a closeted queer at the time, had body image issues, and got bullied by the other guys at school for being effeminate. I never felt like I ‚Äúbelonged‚Äù as part of any group of people, and I guess that sense of belonging is something I‚Äôve craved. Whenever I feel excluded from a social event or not invited to something, I‚Äôll experience major FOMO and feel irrationally sad and salty about it.

This is also when something I call ‚Äúthe cycle‚Äù started. It goes like this. I‚Äôd meet new people, and I naturally connect with people very well, so we‚Äôd get close really quickly. However, as time passed, it seemed like the relationship would die down, and I would find myself feeling insecure and needy for attention. I‚Äôd keep thinking about the person, and whenever they seemed to be ignoring me or talking to or hanging out with other people and not me, I‚Äôd get passive aggressive, angry, or do stupid shit to get their attention. After doing these things, I‚Äôd deeply regret doing that stuff and apologize for it, but this erratic behaviour would eventually drive people away. I‚Äôd keep asking myself ‚ÄúWhy am I like this?‚Äù, because I knew my actions were toxic and wrong, but I couldn‚Äôt control it. The rational side of me would know so-and-so was busy, but the emotional beast would tell me ‚Äúoh they‚Äôre ignoring you. You‚Äôre not good enough for them‚Äù.

It‚Äôs happened many times, from middle school onward to the present day (I‚Äôm 24 now). It happens most intensely with people I have a romantic interest in, but can happen with anyone I talk to a lot. It most recently ended with my first boyfriend. It was a long-distance relationship and he was busy, but I thought I could finally break the cycle with him, but I never fully communicated this neediness with him, worried it would scare him away, but eventually all the passive-aggressiveness and saltiness did that anyways. Often after these cycles, I‚Äôd spiral into depression, thinking that I couldn‚Äôt or didn‚Äôt deserved to be loved by others.

My mom also seemed to undergo changes from the separation. She became a lot moodier. I suspect it could be bipolar disorder or some type of undiagnosed mental condition. Sometimes she was very supportive and caring, but other times she‚Äôd become vicious, blaming me for things that were outside my control. One example is how during the financial crisis, she wanted to invest in real estate but didn‚Äôt have a broker nor was she proficient in English, so she wanted me, an eighth grader, to do it which is obviously silly. She continues to blame me for that to this day. Like a lot of Asian parents, she‚Äôs also quite controlling, and seems fixated on my appearance. I‚Äôm living at home after university right now and it‚Äôs been tough. For example, she insists on combing my hair her way everyday. 

TL;DR so it seems the lack of consistent affection in my childhood led me to have anxious attachment and preoccupied attachment. It seems that I gain too much of my self-confidence from others. I honestly haven‚Äôt been able to connect with ‚Äúmainstream gay culture‚Äù very well, because I know that with these attachment issues I can‚Äôt mentally deal with hookup culture, and I wonder if there are others out there that feel the same way.

However, I recognize that this is NOT who I want to be and that I can‚Äôt let it control me any longer. I recognize that I‚Äôve been asking myself the wrong questions. Instead of asking ‚Äúwhy am I like this?‚Äù I should be saying ‚ÄúOk this is not who I am. What can I do to tame this beast?‚Äù. Over the past year, especially with the help of that first relationship, I‚Äôve gained a lot of confidence in myself. I started a side gig running an e-commerce site, doing vlogging, and so on. Heck, it‚Äôs amazing that the guy who had too little self-esteem to hear his voice or watch himself on audio/video is doing these things. Recently, I‚Äôve started doing therapy sessions and have done a number of things to help deal with this. I‚Äôve been trying to heal that wounded inner child, and recently wrote a letter to 14 year old me. I‚Äôve also been trying to set more boundaries with my mom, more open with friends about these feelings, and being more critical when I find myself having those thoughts. However, I‚Äôd deeply appreciate more tips and goals on how to overcome these attachment issues, since I want to regain control of my life. Thanks in advance for your help peeps, and stay safe doing these troubled times.",justkindoflost,2
2020-05-28 11:19:47,reddit_post,"Anxiety over older parent TL;DR at end. 

I‚Äôm in the running for a few jobs. Just recently graduated. I‚Äôm 36, so late bloomer. My mom and husband are my points of anxiety. My mom has been the cause of my anxiety since around the time my grandma (her mom) died. I realized my mom would die too one day. And it freaks me out. I‚Äôve had exactly one job and it was for 15 months. I failed classes so that didn‚Äôt work. 

I was having a great time since graduating applying for jobs, feeling like I‚Äôm finally ready and my mental health is there... .... then it happens. 

My mom fell out of bed has a gash in her face that will leave a scar cuz she should have gone and gotten stitches and got some xrays done. But she broke her nose, plus some bone in there, messed up her sinus cavities, might need facial reconstruction surgery, broke her thumb, sprained her arm, and her middle toe on one foot is numb. Plus her A1c was 14.8, apparently she got blisters inside her skin on her stomach where she was giving the insulin so she quit to let it heal and just 3 months ago we‚Äôd finally gotten it down to 9.1. My sister claims to be her caregiver but she‚Äôs always bitching about shit. Like she‚Äôs pissed mom fell out of bed, like she was purposefully drunk and went wee! No she was fucking sleeping and rolled and went off. She has rails that go on her side, but she has to pee a lot cuz she coughs a lot (get to that in a minute) and with the rails on she ends up peeing the bed. So we bought adult diapers for her today so we can put the rails on the bed. Now, with her face messed up. If she sneezes hard or coughs hard with her eyes open her eye can pop out. So that‚Äôs great, cuz she coughs like all the fucking time. She has COPD and really bad allergies and here in Texas we get all kinds of shit in the air year round and she‚Äôs always coughing. She sneezes enough to make us worry as well. We are pretty sure she had a stroke, but it was only one sentence she slurred but with the swelling in her face she has a droopy lip so until the swelling goes down and how it all heals it might stay. We are hoping it‚Äôs just the swelling. But her doc wants a CT on her head and X rays on her hand and arm. He really thinks she had a stroke. She‚Äôs half not there all the time so for the most part we don‚Äôt notice a difference but some days we are just like wtf is going on? She can‚Äôt keep a conversation for very long, she‚Äôll start up a conversation then legit just stop talking likes she‚Äôs done and she has yet to finish the thought. So her brain capacity isn‚Äôt quite there all the time. She was on like 12 different meds and we‚Äôve been dwindling down on a lot they thought she had epilepsy but that is just not true so her doc took her back off that. Dropped 3 of the 5 blood pressure meds. And a few others. And her memory has gotten better since dropping some meds but not like we had hoped. And she hasn‚Äôt fallen out of bed in months until the other night. 

Now, me trying to work I feel like I‚Äôm going to be missing out of spending time with her even tho I find it extremely annoying. I‚Äôm not good with kids or old people. I don‚Äôt have patience for it. Exactly why I don‚Äôt have kids! I have dogs and a cat and a husband. Plenty for me. So it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôd spend more time that normal with her, but it‚Äôs like FOMO. If she dies it‚Äôll be less time I spent with her. And my husband knows this and understands. But at the same time we want our own place eventually so I need to work as well. Plus, he wants to go back to school (at 50) and change careers. The way he takes care of himself he won‚Äôt live another 10-15 years if I‚Äôm lucky to get that many. Finally getting his diabetes under control then he goes and fucks shit up again cuz he‚Äôs lazy about taking meds and won‚Äôt give up the damn soda. His doc is like drink diet or a zero get off the regular and he just refuses says it tastes like shit. Well honey your gonna keep having more and more neuropathy cuz you‚Äôre not taking care of it. So which would you have? He complains about neuropathy pain constantly but apparently it‚Äôs not too much to quit regular sodas yet. 

So here I am, with this going on. My mom not doing well again. Last time I was doing an internship and she fell out of bed and broke her back. I quit so I could stay home with her cuz her boyfriend is useless and my sister had classes everyday of the week that semester. So it was up to me. I panicked at work. Constantly looking at my phone worried id get a text ‚Äúmoms...‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt get a chance to say good bye or tell her how much I love her and it just causes great anxiety with thinking about what I‚Äôm leaving when I go to work. I take Xanax only a 0.25mg but it‚Äôs usually enough to stop the crying and short of breath but doesn‚Äôt stop the brain from running a million miles an hour worrying about her. 

I wish I could get therapy again maybe talking it all out with someone will help? Idk. My sister is like well she‚Äôs gonna die someday so I don‚Äôt think about it. I‚Äôm like how fucking crude like damn dude it‚Äôs your mother. But then again that‚Äôs how I felt about our dad when he died years ago. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do with all this anxiety. I have a job interview tomorrow afternoon and I‚Äôm petrified of doing it but I will. I need a job if not to build a life with my husband if only to help with bills. I can‚Äôt just take a Xanax every 4-6 hours to stop the anxiety it just doesn‚Äôt work that way. 

If you read this thanks. I just needed to get it out to someone/something. I wish it helped more than it did. But I don‚Äôt need a Xanax anymore for the night.

edit; sorry if this is really negative and not anxiety related; i'm not saying everyone with anxiety is as useless as me, and i'm not trying to use anxiety as an excuse... i just feel rough

also; i would post this on a throwaway but i'm against that personally because reddit is meant to be the place i can express myself without feeling anxious so fuck it",nervous-pangolin,4
2020-01-10 23:33:31,reddit_post,"Worry effects limbs, and current adult life struggles I have been thinking too much about my mood disorder and mental health in general.  This morning it hit me, I am not feeling right, may be do to weed, general daily activity level, bad sleep hygiene, and spending time with bipolar friend who supported me to change.  

I have and take the ""right"" supplements. (For ex: St Johns Wort, ashwagandha, magnesium, valerian root, Vitamin D with Vitamin K and Vitamin B12.)  I try not to vent too much to hurt my family and close friends, I cut out alcohol/social media stalking, I kept off nicotine, I walk in the park when the weather is nice, and I try to keepmy worry-time in the AM. I try to smile more and make fun appt. plans for MY future, so I don't think of my past-current day negatively, my neck pain, my lack of life goal progress (mainly a career, partner, new people to love), FOMO, and my seeming inability to find meaningful work in this small college town in a desolate cold place without many people open to friendship/companionship in realtime/realspace.  My thinking may be distorted from my episodic symptoms with my negative mood and my own version of inner criticism that cycles from feeling not productive at all to overwhelmed by the lots of what I could be doing.

I already cried twice this early morning after not being able to sleep soundly and am worried for my friend (co-dependency issues) who has even worse mood issues than me, and criminal ones as well.  I just can't stop worrying about him and wish I could do something for him (rescuing), but he is an adult who has to live outcome with his behaviors.  I just find it odd that my worries manifest as arm weakness and fatigue this AM.

THREE things to be grateful for:  stores to buy/shop for what I need and the ability to pay for them within budgeted means, streaming entertainment choices that I CHOOSE to consume, and being a gentler friend to myself.

I also was reading up on personality disorders after a smart friend told me to check out schizotypal one that I might have.  It seems to fit, but I know I can't diagnosis myself and all disorders are on a spectrum.  The symptom of ideas of reference used to fit me, but I work cognitively to understand the distortions I make to conversations/mini interpersonal events that happen around me but I have no meaningful cause/effect. I could go talk to someone professionally again, but all they just seem to do is listen.  I do know they have the right advice or insight to help me get relief from pain.

It really doesn't matter (or does it) but even writing this down and looking at it, makes me believe I am just lonely, middle aged, and chronically unemployed (though my small business ownership does provide me a modest income to live on.)  

This self (points to me the writer) cannot spend so much time alone doing nothing for my mind starts to make things up without a problem to solve and having a breathing person around to unwind with. Also, having a willingness to change does nothing if you don't know what your changing into...  I just don't want spend the next ten years alone and in negative emotional spaces without earnings from my labor.  AND, I hope to challenge this thought, even if I can't find what I am looking for.  Trying new ways of coping like using this forum and trying out video games to left off the pressure that job/dating search stressors.  Thank you.",Calmaxel,3

I have always had anxiety my whole life, but some parts have gotten better since high school and some worse. My social anxiety has gotten a lot better, but now I have major anxiety about my school work. I constantly am thinking about what I have to do and if I am even going to pass at all. It is almost like I have FOMO (fear of missing out) with school. like I cannot do anything else without feeling guilty for not studying. Whenever I take a simple quiz my body just tenses up and my heart rate skyrockets. I am not the brightest person, but I do okay in school. I have a 3.53 GPA and I am a junior. I am taking 3 split level grad courses, all science classes and organic chemistry too (basically a split level bc its sooo difficult). I think the reason why I worry so much is that I feel like my life depends on graduating. with my degree, I am getting a job with little social interaction (a lab job). like if I don't graduate idk what job I would get with my anxiety.

2019-11-06 20:34:58,reddit_post,"Anxiety is ruining my relationships So I (F22) made plans to go out with my boyfriend (M23) yesterday - it was Guy Fawkes/Bonfire Night in the UK, which is special to me as I would spend it with my family. But now as I‚Äôm 200miles+ away from them, I can‚Äôt. You have to get tickets to see the fireworks in the UK, but all events were sold out, so the plan was to go close to a field and then try to see some. 

So according to me I needed to be ready for around 8.20pm - but the plans were still unclear and I didn‚Äôt know what we were doing or what time I needed to be ready for. I was working from home all day and decided to clean our apartment (6.50pm) I felt dusty after cleaning so wanted to shower. I felt that if I didn‚Äôt shower then I would just not be at peace. He arrived home from work around 7.30pm and I was still cleaning, he said that I have to be ready for 8pm latest. I said that I need to shower and get ready (I take around an hour for that). I just completely lost track of time and started getting anxious about it. I said that we can just stay at home instead. But it was bonfire night and I wanted to watch some fireworks (FOMO if I didn‚Äôt). I was very anxious and decided to shower quickly. 

As I got out of the shower, I couldn‚Äôt find anything to wear, I realised that I had a few things to do before going out and without doing those, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to continue with my evening (would take at least 30minutes ontop), I realised that we were not going to make it to the fireworks and became super upset about it. I couldn‚Äôt stop crying because I knew that my anxiety was a big block for me here and that if I didn‚Äôt suffer so much from it, we could have had a nice evening. I was messaging him during the day and told him that I am sad as I miss my family on this day and then I told him that he knew that I was upset all day because I wanted to see the fireworks and that he should have planned something properly with proper timings and given them to me so that I know exactly when to be ready by. And if we weren‚Äôt able to see fireworks, he still should have planned something and said ‚Äúlook, I know this day means a lot to you, so we will go to see fireworks, if we can‚Äôt, then I have made a reservation at this restaurant for this time so we can go there instead‚Äù - because if he told me that he is upset and this day meant a lot to him, I would make sure that I plan something for him without fail - and that is how I would have said it to him.

I then started thinking about what I was doing last year on this day (spent with ex). And I told my current boyfriend that he is boring as he doesn‚Äôt have any interests or show me new things/ take me out to new places. I hate to say it but I was comparing the two and he could blatantly see that I was doing that. He started getting upset and apologetic over the fact that I said that he has no interests. 

It is so horrible because I feel like my anxiety just ruined the whole evening. If I had no anxiety - I would have gotten ready and continued with the plans. But my anxiety made me want to - shower, get anxious about the lack of time, cry about what I was doing last year in comparison to this year, blame my boyfriend for being boring and not having any interests. 

I just feel like I was taking it out on him when it wasn‚Äôt even his fault. If I was just ready on time then it would have been fine. My anxiety is the highest that it has ever been right now and I feel like I am in a vicious cycle of panic.",N25_,2

But im going to be honest that if what you said about your boyfriend is true, and he truly doesnt do new things without you and doesnt have any personal interests.

We were originally not gonna do anything crazy but then people wanted to go clubbing and since I have extreme FOMO and want to be the fun person, I was up for it. Coming to the club, my friend had some trouble with their card in the entrance. ""I'll take it"", I said, and waved for the other people we were with to come along. Ended up paying for all their entrances. Two of them I don't know and have no way of getting that money back. Then inside of the club I paid for drinks for everyone. On the way home, I ended up buying a cab for us to get home, which was extremely overpriced.

I spent almost all of my money. I have a birthday party coming up in a week that I need to help arrange, also money-wise. There's two weeks before the paycheck arrives and due to recent bullshit in my life, my savings have been drained.

2019-08-17 06:42:51,reddit_post,"This is why you will get through your anxiety November 2018 - May 2019. Certainly a group of months to forget you would supposedly think however in a way this time period came to be one of the fundamental chapters in the book of my life.

Many people resort to a particular moment when they started feeling different, becoming more sad and increasingly more thoughtful of the worst. The truth is that this isn't due to a particular day, month or year. I can look at November 2018 and mislead you to believe that my anxiety started then. The reality is that there has been a collection of moments spanning from weeks, to years that have lead to this trojan horse of emotion. 

I look back at my youth (7-13). I used to move schools a lot, check. 

(13-17) I lost friends many friends because I lied a lot, constantly thinking how I could fuck up good relationships, FOMO, thinking about girls, losing girls online, shyness, lack of responsibility, no physical activity, no interest in school work, only interest in gaming, losing friends through gaming, Always checking what my friends are posting on instagram, terrible diet

When you are in your youth, your brain is developing. Particular events happen which has no meaning to you then but later on effects you further down the line. You may call this the Butterfly effect. Reality is often hurtful but in a way my anxiety was always going to happen due to the trauma I often unconsciously caused myself. Losing friends and making friends again. This is a traumatic experience as relationships is one of the fundemental aspects of being human. Of course you may call yourself an introvert however even you will hold a relationship, whether that be with your parents or the store owner down the road. Losing good relationships is most definitely one catalyst.

With anxiety though, it is often the case that you won't be able to actually point to one particular moment which caused it as it is a buildup over years. 

In November I started my first job, 17 years of age and no previous mental health problems. Over my first few weeks I became obsessive over the thought that I might be homosexual despite only being interested in girls over the span of my existence. I can go into detail as to what I thought, how the thoughts even appeared however I'm sure you have heard it all before. The point is that it was an anxious thought. It never meant anything to me until that point. And it hurts me just as your thoughts hurt you.

Routines.

To put it into more context, to get over anxiety is to be in a routine. My mother often comes to me asking almost daily questions like ""did you often feel sad in the mornings?"" and I always tell her that routines saved me. I cannot stress this enough. When I was at my worst point I had to keep a routine. I started going to the gym every 2-3 days, I started eating better and caring for myself, awaking at set times every morning, I started reading. Albeit half of 1984 but I started reading. The point is that I was responsible for myself for the first time in my life. I cared about who I was and what I was doing. 

*You have to care for yourself before you can care for others*

Although I stayed with my anxiety long after introducing this system, you have to let the anxiety happen, you are tired. start taking care for yourself and accept the feeling because everyone will experience it within their lives. The ones who aren't with us today are the ones who couldn't accept it. It is about doing what you can in the moment and if you can start living by each day as opposed to thinking about when you will be better, it will slowly fade from existence and you will be living happier and healthier for it. 

I am a few months rid of anxiety and its terror however, with my new implemented self-care system, I am ready for round two if it decides to step in the ring with me again.",WaldtheWise,5

2019-11-27 17:26:20,reddit_post,"Feeling my friends slipping away from me and next year worries. Umm so I attend secondary school and I kinda noticed that the distance between me and my friend circle is kinda steadily increasing. Unlike last year, I seem to be slowly kind of feeling them drifting away. One example of this is that some of them have started to hang out in small, select groups amongst themselves and invite each other out but I'm usually not invited. 

I'm not gonna lie, I'm probably suffering from major FOMO, but it really hurts when I open Instagram and see stories of them spending time together without me knowing. To make things worse, we're streaming classes next year and being an introvert, I'm really scared that I may end up without any friends in the next few years of my secondary education, and I get anxious and super stressed out just thinking of it.

2018-02-21 13:34:24,reddit_post,"Wanting to see a Therapist but unsure how to take the first step This is kinda half venting and half asking for advice on what to do.

I've been wanting to see a therapist for a while now, but I've never seen one. And the only time I've seen someone similar was a Personal Wellness counselor back at my old community college; nice guy but all he did was give me some BS about kids not knowing what educational path to take and have me a piece of paper that listed cause and effects of anxiety and how to feel happy. It wasn't very useful. 

I've always had symptoms of anxiety and depression, and from what I understand there's a family history of it. I really don't know how to describe it because I have days where I'm laid back and chilled to the point nothing bothers me. But I also have those days where even the smallest minute issue bothers me to no end. I've heard that keeping a journal is handy with identifying problems but when I finally get myself to sit down and write my thoughts out my mind seems to go blank. However, on the odd chance I can write something down and make logical conclusions of what's causing the issue I can reassure myself nothings wrong. But later that night I can sit here and dwell on it and create a hundred random reasons that don't make sense that could cause those issues. I'll sit or lay there until I exhaust myself before I fall asleep.  

As for dealing with it I curb my social anxiety by having a few drinks in the right setting or I finally overcome the barrier of FOMO and join in and have fun. But afterwards I just kinda crash back to stage 1. I usually have venting sessions with a few friends to get stuff off my mind. It feels nice for a while but afterwards I eventually crawl back to my same old self.

I guess what I'm trying to say, and I apologize if half of this makes sense, is that I want to approach a therapist but I'm scarred to because I feel like I won't be prepared, and I guess this is something you can't fully be prepared because you can't have a list of every exact thing that bothers you. When I finally take that step I want to atleast have a list of a few things that are bothering me so I have something to talk about otherwise I'm just going to sit there and randomly vent the whole time. 

So I guess what I'm asking for is advice on at least how to write a few ideas down so I have something to talk about. And I'm afraid to take the first step but I really think it's time to start fixing this life lone issue instead of trying to cope with it or sweep it under the rug anymore. 

My employer does have an Employee Assistance Program that includes a few therapist sessions, I've had the damn brochure on my desk for a few weeks now, but I'm scared to pick up the phone and dial the number because I think I'll just tense up and freeze and won't know what to say.

However I'm glad I did, it's really helped me cope with my depression and anxiety. When I first went in I had a general idea of all the things that have been bugging me causing me to feel like shit. I didn't really know what to expect, but therapy is a two way street you can choose how you want sessions to go. You can choose to just go in and vent, or just go in and do relaxation techniques it depends on what you hope to gain.

2018-02-21 13:46:44,reddit_comment,"Hiya. Be proud of yourself for reaching out on here and wanting to get professional help. As far as what types of things you can tell the therapist, here's something that you may find useful:

(If possible) Before seeing a professional, I recommend writing down any symptoms you're experiencing along with context like a brief summary. It can be hard to just write without any direction, so hopefully the questions below can help give some guidance. I compiled the questions I've been asked at my own appointments. You don't have to write down your answers to all of these questions, although you are certainly free to do that. There's also no pressure to write anything down at all. Keep in mind that the professional just wants to get a clear picture of your life, so that they can give you the best care possible. Their intention is NOT to interrogate you and get you to confess a crime. They want to help you get better, and in order to do that, they need to know details about your life! When you're finished, consider bringing this paper and just show it to the professional because that can take pressure off of you to perform on the spot! Here are the questions:
	
>1. what would you like help with?
>2. what are your symptoms?
>3. when did your symptoms first start?
>4. how often do your symptoms occur? All the time? At specific times of the day like before bed or when you wake up?
>5. how severe would your symptoms on a scale of 1-10? Rate the quality of your life on a scale of 1-10.
>6. how are your energy levels/motivation? High, normal, low, very low?
>7. how is your appetite? Are you eating too much, too little, or a normal amount?
>8. how is your sleep quality (good or bad)? How many hours of sleep per day? Do you feel well-rested?
>9. have you lost interest in any hobbies or passions?
>10. do you isolate yourself from others? 
>11. what is your school/social/work/home life like? (basically, the professionals want to know if your    struggles are impacting different areas of your life and how much. For example, if you're in school and you're failing classes because you're depressed, it's important to say that you're failing classes)
>12. how is your ability to focus and retain information? 
>13. do you think anything has contributed to the way you are feeling like the death of a loved one?
>14. how are your stress levels? How stressed do you feel on a daily basis? Anything causing stress like work or school? 
>15. do you have a family history of depression/anxiety/anything else?
>16. have you had any thoughts of ending your life and/or harming yourself?
>17. have you harmed yourself or attempted suicide?
>18. do you experience racing thoughts?
>19. how would you describe your self-esteem? High, low, etc.
>20. do you feel nervous often? When do you feel nervous? All the time? In front of others? Alone?
>21. how would you describe your sex drive (none, low, medium, high?)
>22. do you feel fatigued? How often are you fatigued/exhausted?
>23. how often do your symptoms occur? Sometimes, all the time, rarely?
>24. have you gained or lost weight recently? If so, how much?
>25. do you experience any body aches? Joint pain?
>26. do you feel like you move or talk slowly? Have others noticed this?
>27. have you experienced a sudden onset of anxiety like a panic attack? how would you describe this panic attack/sudden experience of anxiety? Does it happen in crowds, alone at home, randomly, during sleep?
>28. do you ever feel hopeless? If so, how often? Or like you've let yourself or others down?
>29. are you taking any medication and/or supplements? If so, which ones and how much?
>30. do you use any drugs in a recreational manner? If so, how much and how often?",dwade333miami,1

2019-07-29 14:11:28,reddit_post,"Attraction-Based Anxiety? (Almost NSFW) Has anyone ever felt really overwhelmed or anxious with your attraction to a significant other?

Whenever I see my fiancee naked, in underwear or even in something flattering, I get that way.  I've blamed myself for being overly sexual (which it often manifests as) but I think her body actually gives me anxiety. And I feel unable to turn my attraction off, which I would just love to be able to do like the flip of a switch..  It would be great to see her body and NOT think of it in a sexual way.  I feel like my mind is way too focused on her body and on sex but I just get triggered easily and have a hard time shifting my brain, especially when I feel this way often when I see parts of her body. While it often is, it's not always an urge to have sex but an attraction that I don't know how to keep in check. Her body makes me feel uncomfortable even.

By the way, I am a 24yo male with GAD.  One big thing I've struggled in the past with is retroactive jealousy, which I just got ""over"", realizing it's a combination between me trying to attribute a problem to my general anxiety but also just growing up lonely with some unhealthy non-positive views of sex (probably due to the porn addiction my whole life until maybe six months ago).  I'm not sure if this could have anything to do with it so I thought I'd mention that.  Sometimes the feeling is very similar to what I felt with RJ.

I have also not been in many relationships and none that were healthy until now, so maybe that has something to do with it, now that I'm with an attractive woman who's good to me? Is it because I don't feel like I deserve her or think she's going to go away someday?  I also have FOMO a lot so maybe when I have the opportunity to look at her and/or have sex, I feel like I have to cherish every second and take every opportunity?

I know I can't possibly expect any of you to help me out or figure out the root of the issue without knowing me and a million other details.  I just thought I'd throw this out here to see if there's a term for this, if anyone else has experienced it, and if anyone has a hunch on what I could do.  Right now, I'm creating a list of strategies that might be able to help me in the future.  I'm hoping it helps.

So here's some backstory.
Me and my gf have been together a touch over 6 years now. At first I had huge issues trusting her, but I do with anyone (I used to always not trust my parents and think I was adopted or something... ikr, dumb af).

Now it got bad about 2 years in, she made a really stupid choice and decided she was telling me she was going to meet up with her female cousin, I even dropped her off and she actually went to meet her male ""bestie"" who she met at work and they were texting 24/7 even infront of me. Of course I wasn't comfortable with it, but I don't stop her doing anything and I never let her know I'm not comfortable with it... I just bottle it up. Now as far as I know they never did anything, she met him at work and they walked to his house then she went home (she didn't go inside or anythjng) apparently he wanted a chat about something. Now that would have all been perfectly fine if she hadn't have lied to me, That's the worst bit.

Ok and since then there has been more incident where she's lied to me, but nothing super major (nothing to do with other men), so I just ignore it. She's a very shy and nervous person, she will just say something quickly when she feels pressured even if it's wrong without even thinking about it, then be too nervous to correct it.

Now fast forward to this week, she's gone to Ibiza with her female best friend and their other female best friend (who also has a long term boyfriend). Apparently this is the ""sex capital"" of the world and now I'm just super worried she's going to cheat or something, and I'll never find out. I'm also worried she may get drugged or raped or something horrible happen and I'm not there to protect her, apparently there's shit loads of booze and boys with nothing but tits and ass on their mind...
Not only that but if she does cheat and doesn't tell me, then I get an STD from it... wtf do I do then??
But ultimately what if she doesn't have the intention of cheating, goes through several bottles of booze, keep getting hit on then a f*cking greek god comes out of nowhere and she fucks him.

 We've moved in together about 3 months ago and if she did cheat honestly I think I'd just top myself, my entire life is dedicated to giving US the best future, the reason for me working hard at work and getting promotions and pay rises is for US and NOT me.
I don't see anything but US in our future and we've talked about marriage, kids, getting a house next year, how I want to buy her a car she's after and a dog etc.

How do I stop myself being so anxious about this, I literally get diarrhoea (sorry for being explicit) from the level of nerves I go through, sometimes can't sleep and sometimes just sit and cry (which fuck, I'll never admit, not even to my gf). 6'1"" 300lbs dude crying like a baby. Lol.

2018-07-19 02:40:44,reddit_comment,"First off, I'm not going to get into my own situation here, but I will say that I suffer from quite bad relationship anxiety (some to do with sex, some with commitment, etc), and the relationship I am currently in is the only one I've been in and I also lost my V card. So I can at least relate somewhat.

The reality is that there are two major types of people (and of course a spectrum in between) that would react two ways in the relationship you guys are in. This is a generalization, but I'm going to categorize it as people that have serious FOMO (fear of missing out), and those that don't. You've been in a relationship with this person for a long time, and if you both lost your V to each other that means neither of you have been with anyone else before. 

For people that have FOMO, that gives them serious anxiety and restlessness. They feel like they're missing out on experiencing life to it's fullest, and that going out and being crazy for a while, or having sex with lots of people is something they have to do. 

For those of us without it, none of that really bothers us, and we don't think about it as often. I could have sex with one person for my entire life and not be with anyone else and it really doesn't bug me one bit. Neither of these is ""better"" or ""more right"" than the other, it's just how different people feel.

From what you've said, it really feels like neither of you have FOMO about this. And I can't really imagine you being together for 6 years and not knowing that about the other person. So you can cross off the idea that she is going there with the intention of cheating. Yes, maybe a god of a man starts hitting on her, but if she's so shy and nervous (and you know this for sure, as im sure you do after 6 years), I can't see her just going along with hooking up with a random guy. Maybe if she was going with two female friends who are both single, but if one of her friends is also in a long term relationship I don't think there is any nefarious intention to this trip.",FairyLord,3

2018-08-31 12:52:26,reddit_post,"Extremely stressful work environment and how it affects my anxiety and depression Hi there,

I work as a Marine Fisheries Observer. My job is to accompany commercial fishing vessels into the field and to monitor their bycatch, target species, and survey their fishing techniques. For each contract, I am put into the field for approximately 90 days, this field being the Bering Sea surrounding the Aleutian Islands in Alaska (yeah, where Deadliest Catch takes place). When I signed up to do this job, I had visions of adventure on the high seas but what I didn‚Äôt realize was how it would affect my mental health. Depression and anxiety are the two killers. I now have issues sleeping due to an irregular sleep schedule and regular panic periods (I wouldn‚Äôt call them panic attacks per se but I feel extreme stress during these). Thoughts can spiral down quickly, starting with thinking my friends/family/significant other are forgetting about me, extreme sense of FOMO, creeping imposter syndrome, and an urge to talk to someone (not always possible with boat wifi and phones). My family and friends are all very proud of me but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôm not good enough. I‚Äôm on break now until October, where I will be put on assignment on a longliner, a fishing gear which goes out for 21-40 day periods, usually has no contact with the outside, and where I will be standing outside for hours at a time. I guess I‚Äôm starting to really worry about what could happen if I go into the field and start breaking down. Anyone have any pointers or advice?",Ktegrace,2
2016-12-23 06:00:50,reddit_post,"I could really use someone to talk to/Need to vent I'm not even sure if this is the best subreddit to post this because there's also depression involved and I'm mostly venting, but it's always felt like the safest place to post here.


I've tried typing the whole story out a bunch of times but it's really long and I'm kind of scared no one will read it if it looks daunting, but I'll share the whole thing if anyone wants to talk.


Essentially I had a bad break up that I was able to get over in the summer but now I'm kind of back in pieces because my ex came back into my life and sort of emotionally unloaded on me, saying things that wore me down even though I don't think they really meant to. We agreed to stop talking for a while to focus on our mental health.

And now I'm kind of at my most vulnerable and I'm really sad because I'm home from school for winter holidays, and my ex goes to the same school as I do, and has a group of friends that I used to be friends with but am now more or less estranged from but friendly when I see them, and also I share a best friend with my ex and I live in a different city from all of these people. And even though my ex told me how sad they are/how they weren't doing well/dislike their friends, I'm still jealous that all of these people live in the same city and all I can do is have awful fantasies of all of them hanging out and having fun without me. And so right now I'm in this state of high anxiety where I can't appreciate my own life at all, and they're all off probably getting more successful in their field (I'm in a similar/almost the same field but I don't perceive any of my friends or colleagues to be as 'cool' or 'successful' as my exes' friends, which makes me feel like a terrible, judgmental person) and I'm in general feeling like I'm just sitting here being replaced, hanging out with my own dumb mediocre friends (which is an awful thing to think).


Logically I know this probably isn't the case. I've had this happen to me a number of times, even before my ex and I dated, as they were all in the same friend group and would go off for summer break, and I'd be stuck in my own city, scared of what I was missing out on. And i'd always find out that it wasn't actually that much that I missed. And I'd always end up getting over it and hanging out with people in my own city and having an alright time. 

But I'm really scared. I don't know, the field of work we're in is pretty small in the sense that there's a community and people tend to know each other. The way I was able to ""get over"" my ex (and didn't even want to get back together at the time) was to have zero contact, and a full time summer job and other kids to hang out with. But our lives are really close together. We share a best friend. My ex is bound to pop up in my life once in a while and I'm afraid because I'm so vulnerable right now. I'm surprised how sensitive I am, and how the littlest things set me off and I'm so afraid that I'll never be happy. I'm afraid that my ex's group of friends are the centre of the universe because they're all so fucking talented, and even though they like my work too I feel like I'll never be ""in there"". And I know that once I get over it I won't care how much fun they're having but I can't stop thinking about how our lives will always be close. And we want to ultimately be friends if it's possible to but I just feel so fucked up right now. 


Also because I'm afraid of how much I'm missing out on, I'm really  competitive and constantly wondering if I""m socializing enough or going out enough, and wondering if I have enough friends. I wanted to spend the entire day at home the other day but it was almost unbearable and I entered a really weird state of fogginess because I felt so guilty about doing nothing. I can't even do the work I love because school burned me out from it. I feel like right now the only solution is to move to a different country and make different friends and have a completely new social circle but I know that that isn't necessarily the way to go and that escaping isn't good. And I know I'm probably building this all up in my head, and making my ex's friends seem like so much more than they are but I'm in such a high anxiety state that I don't think I can do anything. I feel stuck, hopeless and afraid.

Also, I feel like these feelings are no coincidence because I clearly started feeling this way after my ex and I decided to stop talking. I'm so mad at myself because I'm having obvious withdrawal symptoms and I had already once gotten rid of these (but I had to be completely cut off and the circumstances were good because it was summer) and I'm afraid I'll never be able to replicate that again. I fucking wanna stop caring about being successful or social or partying or FOMO and just relax and be happy but I'm constantly in competition with my ex (not that I want to be, my mind just makes me somehow) and I'm so depressed.


I'm sorry about how long this ended up being. It's not even half of the story and my problems, I know, probably are exaggerated. But I don't know who to talk to because I don't want to bother people about it anymore and could use a shoulder to cry on. I feel so weak because usually all it takes is for someone to say ""you're normal, everyone else is just like you"", because I'm a slave to reassurance but it's insane how depressed and anxious I get when I have to self-reassure. Sort of spiralling righ now.

Thanks for reading",saddumbthroaway,4
2016-12-23 08:31:47,reddit_comment,"I kind of understand that feeling of competition and not doing enough. But the truth is, there is only so much a person can do. When you hyper focus on a subject like socializing, it can really paralyze you from doing anything because you're thinking too much about the end result. And the truth is, like with art, you have to mess up and be vulnerable sometimes before you can really start feeling ok to keep going.

As for the feelings, it really is ok and normal. Unfortunately because it isn't a No Contact, now everything revolving around your ex is kind of meshed together with your friends and life. And Im sure they're a nice person but it does hurt when someone comes back and unloads mental stress on you without considering whether you were ready to deal with it.

I think it might be helpful for you to get to know yourself alone again. Like pick up some hobbies or things for you to do that make you happy when you don't feel like going out. When I was really empty, I filled the void with podcasts. Focusing energy on learning a new skill is also great because not only does it help pass the time, but the feeling of success you get the more you get better at it is really really a confidence booster. And, like you said, sometimes you worry too much about whats going on in the other city. But you end up having good times with your other friends, and I think thats good to think about. If you need to distance yourself from your ex and your shared group of friends, I would say focus on these people who have no ties to them! It may be a sign to move on, and I think it is worth indulging in new experiences.

Finally, I think if No Contact was what was useful to you guys, you may need to talk to your ex again. Even if its just a conversation about mental things, I think it's really helpful to get these feelings out and not bury them. If you really cannot cope, be honest to your ex and yourself. Its very possible you don't need to have no contact, and that by talking,you guys can just be friends again. But I think it is important to at least set things straight.

I hope you feel better soon and start enjoying things again, sending hugs and good vibes!",chix-stix,2

2018-06-29 07:18:17,reddit_post,"How to get over idea of girlfriend getting high For the record, I know this situation is incredibly benign and if I were a reasonable person it would not bother me at all. But that is why I am asking for help here.

My girlfriend \[we're both 25\] had tried pot a few times with her family (parents, siblings, aunts/uncles, and cousins all have done it at family gatherings) both before we started dating and during our relationship (but without me). This is a thing they do sometimes when all the cousins are together, smoking or eating pot and hanging out. She prefers edibles and is health-conscious, so she refuses to smoke if that is all that is available. She actually has anxiety herself, where health concerns is one of her worst triggers, so if she is fine with edibles then I know in my rational mind that it is no big deal. She has also said that she does not plan to try any harder drugs ever.

I, on the other hand, had never tried pot except a couple of joints with other friends the summer before starting this relationship, and never felt high at all. My family is much more conservative about drugs (and alcohol, as we have had some problems with alcoholism in the past), so I find the idea of getting high as a family activity to be incredibly strange. My thought process is like, why can't you just enjoy your cousins' company normally? You haven't seen these people in many months and the first thought is let's all get stoned? I am comparing it to something like always wanting to get drunk if you are around family, which to me is a sign that you dislike them and do not want to be there, or do not think you can enjoy them without the artificial euphoria from drugs. So I just find it very difficult to understand why this is something they choose to do as a family.

I feel I am overreacting because she claims not to be drawn to being high, only does it to be social at these family events, doesn't really enjoy it much and prefers feeling tipsy with alcohol, and doesn't need to be high in order to enjoy family interactions. I have talked with her at great length about all this, and she has helped me try to get past my hangups about drugs. I knew the only way to get past this would be to try it with her. We tried edibles just the two of us twice recently. The first time I was totally anxious and did not enjoy the high, while she could barely keep her eyes open and was chowing down on pizza while barely being able to hold a conversation with me, almost like the girl I love spending time with wasn't really there. I found it to be a terrible experience and definitely not a state in which I could have any meaningful bonding moments. The second time, however, I went in with a better mindset and we actually enjoyed watching TV, cooking, playing games, and walking around outside. She was more alert as well and seemed more herself, not like the couch zombie from the first time. The two experiences were like night and day. After the second time I felt much more at ease.

But the ultimate issue, that I still cannot shake, is that the very thought of my girlfriend using pot or any other mind-altering drug just wigs me out, especially if I am not there to see how it affects her. It causes these loops of toxic thought that I cannot escape from. Note that this does not apply to alcohol unless she is getting totally shitfaced, which I know she doesn't because we have drunk together both privately and socially many times before. I rationally know that her getting high with family or friends is basically exactly the same as having a few drinks to feel relaxed and kind of euphoric. I drink with family for the same reasons and have no problem with that. So I should be able to treat pot the same way, but my brain refuses and insists that it is a weird way to spend time with loved ones or your significant other. I think FOMO also has something to do with it, because it sounds like they are having fun being high in that group setting and I have only ever done it the two times alone with her. And because of that I continue to envision her behavior in the party setting as totally different from what I saw of her when we were high together. I know my brain is just projecting fears and images of stoners or addicts onto my mental image of her, quite unfairly.

How can I get a healthier outlook on this? Whenever I start thinking about it, it ruins my day and causes me to lose many hours of sleep. Maybe some pot would help me with this; I say that to poke fun at my own concerns but in all honesty it did relieve some anxiety and help me sleep last time. We have enough to do it one more time but I think I still need to see her do it in a larger group setting, to stop worrying about the inevitability of her doing it again at the next gathering. I do not want to keep bothering her about it. It is my own problem inside my own head and I don't want something this silly to drive a wedge between us. Especially if she decides it's best not to tell me about when she does it, I will feel like she is hiding things, so I really really don't want that outcome. I want to be totally comfortable with the idea and her to be comfortable talking to me about it.

TL;DR: Girlfriend doesn't use any drugs besides alcohol and pot, and only uses pot via edibles as a social activity at gatherings of her extended family. The thought of her doing this, though, causes me anxiety. She and I have worked on getting me over these hangups, but the irrational emotional reaction remains. I want to fix my thought process.",throwaway_166666667,1
2018-04-24 15:58:48,reddit_post,"Now It Really Comes Rushing Back Today I just found out I've got a job interview for a great company, my top pick, actually. However, while this is positive news, it still doesn't help the fact that I'm having anxiety and stress-related thoughts about seemingly everything that's occurred in my life up to this point.





Everyone around me is congratulating me on my coming graduation, wanting to know when the day is and how I feel about it. Honestly, it makes me feel like I want to throw up and then curl into a ball on the ground. I feel like I've coasted through my life as easily as I can, hiding away from things that scare me and throwing away opportunities because I've been too anxious, shy, angry, frustrated, upset, you name it. I couldn't have predicted that this time in my life feels like reality has finally come up to meet me like a sack of bricks, after dwelling in my own comfort zones for years. During my freshman year at college, I remember feeling anxious, but also that everything was so new and exciting. Looking back, I pity myself a little bit just because I was so naive, sheltered, and frightened at the time of all the new encounters and people I was meeting that were much more audacious and extroverted than I was. Just like high school, and middle school, and elementary school, I felt a compulsive need to try and ""fit in."" At this stage of my life, I can say I've learned so much and become such a stronger person, but that also doesn't change the fact that I'm scared shitless of the future and leaving my college behind.





This is sort of ironic, because a year ago I could've told you I didn't want anything to do with people, my campus, or what was going on for group activities. I shut myself away in my apartment smoking weed and doing things by myself. Don't get the wrong impression-I did go out a fair amount of times these past four years, but the tribulations of social groups, being left out, and my own insecurities ultimately left me feeling isolated and depressed. I felt I couldn't relate to anyone, and the pot smoking was the only thing I could say I felt comfort about. Knowing that I could get high and have everything ""fall in place"", I chased that for roughly two years so far on and off smoking daily. 







Now, facing the possibility of a drug test, I feel trapped that I can't continue smoking and visiting my happy place. I know I shouldn't use it for this entire week because I believe the only way I could pass a drug test is to use every day possible beforehand to let the chemicals work themselves out of my system. I feel guilty thinking about just caving and smoking because I know its dumb to assume they may not test me, and that it will very likely come up. 












My anxiety was already bad while I was smoking, as its gotten to a point where marijuana only seems to make me more anxious, but there's also this ominous feeling now like I've finally had to hit Earth again and pick up where I left off before using, especially now that I'm sandwiched in for this week to be sober... Its almost like I'm back to being the same scared little kid I was, worried about my past, my future, dealing with life in general, feeling the butterflies in my stomach. Everyone always says college is the best time of your life, and now its over. I haven't even officially finished yet and I feel like I already wish I could just go back in time and repeat everything.






I've started having this constant battle in my head about whether or not I regret the decisions I've made. For example, is it really plausible to regret your past? Nobody knows what they're doing in life, so how can you understand things until after you can reflect and learn from them? There were many times when I would cave and do something due to FOMO, and while I'm glad I did, I still didn't have all that great a time, so with that being said, is it justifiable to regret not doing something if at the time you wouldn't have enjoyed it/felt good about it anyways? Or maybe that's the game anxiety plays on people, I'm not sure.







The only thought I can say for sure is that I feel deeply anxious about my life currently. Honestly, I never imagined myself growing  up and being an adult. For some reason, my future visions always seemed to end at college, where I could do whatever I wanted, have all the sex and good times in the world, and everything would be great. Now here I am mulling over the fact that its over. I feel horrible. ",textpostmcgee,2

Anyways, I'm always anxious about wanting to succeed in life and literally it will eat me up if I don't do something productive everyday like study or workout. Like today for instance, it was meant to be an off day for me but I just felt anxious out of nowhere and decided to do some work and then go gym. 

I got rid of Instagram and Snapchat 2 years ago seeing as the FOMO made me depressed and given that I got off from a really messed up relationship made me sure of never getting social media. But sometimes I get really insecure and compare my self to people that either hurt me and sometimes would make me feel shit. Sometimes, I actually want to go on a date or something with the opposite sex but after my previous experience, it just puts me off... and not just the actually the experience of the breakup but the events that had happened where my ex would go to everyone and twists things about me causing people to kind of avoid me. She'd emotionally guilt trip me in which I responded to her that she needed medical help. 

I still go to the same high school in the UK and everyday I just feel kind of anxious just even seeing people who remotely know her and it's worse because of the friends i met in a different school I went to last year because I wanted to forget everything that happened with me in my town are pretty much good friends with her now pretty much don't bother to talk to me as much although I could be paranoid. 

So I highly doubt I have feelings for her especially after what happened but I just can't be as confident as I was then because of the effect it had to me. 

Recently, there's this girl in my school who I find attractive and thought on whether I should at least say something before I finish high school (she's a year below) for my gap year. I just hate this fucking place I live in and want to move out somewhere where I can be fully my self. I noticed that when I'm out of town, I'm much more extroverted and love talking and meeting with people. But here, I just feel absolute shit and I just feel so fucking anxious to get good grades...

So for the past few years I've been suffering from (mild i think) depression and anxiety, and my life consists of staying home watching tv while eating my feelings. I've put on a bit of weight, and I haven't seen my extended family for about a year now. This weekend i'm supposed to go to our annual family gathering (3 days long, about 35 people), and of course my anxiety makes me question going. 

Reasons not to go : I'm anxious about being the only one who has put on weight, anxious because i'm pretty much the only introvert in a family of full-on extroverts, and anxious because about 50% of the time i'm with my family i don't enjoy myself (i feel like i'm watching a movie and i'm not one of the characters I'm a part of the audience if that makes sense) 

Reasons to go : major FOMO because everyone is bringing their SO (except me of course..) for the first time, and it's one of the only family gatherings we have every year. Also, i wouldn't have to explain to everybody why i'm not coming. 

Any opinions ? I'm super indecisive ",DinastyOrDieNasty,1
2017-07-30 21:41:33,reddit_post,"Social media triggers Hey, long-time Reddit lurker but made an account today after being on a holiday/vacation which I thought would help my mental health but has seemed to not help at all.

I've had serious anxiety triggered by social media whilst away. Seems to be centred mainly around FOMO/a constant feeling of feeling inadequate. 

After not sleeping for a night, I ended up deleting all social media apps from my phone. It seems to have helped somewhat and yet I'm still having serious FOMO anxiety. 

I've had CBT before but I can't help but feel like this is something more psychological? 

I don't know, I'm just wondering if anyone experiences social media as a trigger and how they manage it. I can't see me cutting it out completely working as I know I'll just end up cutting myself off from all socialising if I do and I know I'll probably get anxious and sad if nobody contacts me after I've taken myself away from it all.

I just don't know how I can win in this situation and it seems to be that my mental health is rapidly declining, possibly due to the recent loss of my father. 

I feel very lost at the moment and can feel myself dissociating and need any advice you can all provide, please. ",Ganxious,2
2017-08-25 16:37:31,reddit_comment,"I just came to a realization that I get similar panic attacks with social media and the 'fear of missing out'. I always have to resort to reminding myself that the event I'm missing out on is something that is out of my control, and that I can only control what is in front of me and that I have to make the best out of it. 
Nonetheless, I am an opportunist. So it sucks to see an opportunity missed. If my anxiety get to a point, I just choose to abstain from social media all together. Even if I talk to my friends, I try to stray away from a potential topic of something that I am missing out from, and just wait until the event passes for me to talk about it. For me at least, I have larger problems with missing things in the moment. Conversations about past events are kind of a lost cause in my head.

2017-02-06 19:06:03,reddit_post,"Does this sound like anxiety, or overthinking? Hi. This is going to be a bit long. but please bare with me.

As I'm on xanax and little more calmer than usual to actually 'feel' the emotions when retelling this story, it feels better to type it out and I need some help clarifying emotions. i've suffered from quite a lot of emotional trauma from home since 8-9, frequently crying and having bad relations at home, by being raised by my mothers quite dysfunctional side who have more or less given me a really hard time while growing up (be it calling me terrible names, being not understanding when i fuck up as a kid, be unnecessarily harsh because of their own upbringing). This and some high school insecurities with a particular boyfriend problem definitely gave me depression. Now, I've been noticing I feel a lot less comfortable around people, micromanaging what i say, afraid of being myself and being weird, forming social groups, and feeling FOMO and deliberately left out if someone doesnt invite me to something.

Secondly, I feel like i idolize people who have it 'good' in life, the privileged kids who have money, good friends, and generally, i try to act like them. I realized I've always tried to act like someone, or copy someone, ever since I was young. I never had enough confidence to be myself or develop my interests (we didnt have much money at home and my mother never believed i would stick to a hobby, which may have been true before), and when I do try to be myself, i feel like i wouldn't have enough people to follow what i think or like me enough to want to be part of my 'group'. I worry if i do speak my mind about someone i disliked, people would ditch and call me a bitch. FYI, I'm 20 and it's ridiculous how fucking insecure i get. 

Lastly, I feel like overanalyze and read into people's expressions, attitudes and what they say a lot, to the point where I very naturally formulate a generalisation/impression of who they are and how they'd act. A lot of the time, i'm right with their character and how dependable they are, but it makes me too aware, too much of an outcast in this seemingly less anxious community. I dont feel natural, but no one knows this, I think. I also remember things pretty well, and sometimes I deliberately pretend to forget certain details of someones life so it doesn't come off creepy, but I really can't help recalling times people told me about something about themselves that I found interesting or just SOMEHOW stuck to my mind.

As you can see, I don't really know what I'm talking about. Yes, i've tried to get help. But I want to self-help myself first, before committing to letting someone completely in on this. I've had low key obsessions with people as I mentioned, just because their lives looked good on social media and were so likable to me and/or others when I hung out with them (and yes I know that it is completely irrational, and for sure people choose what they put online), but I cant help but to always try to morph my attitude into what X would do, or what would X say or what X would post online. 

Essentially, i would just like to know an outsiders opinion. My theory is that I probably do have some kind of anxiety, maybe someone who doesn't have a good home role model to teach me to love myself, or some kind of trauma. I do have intrusive thoughts and feelings of incompetency for the fuck ups I had in high school (grades) and where I am as a young adult in college, and I usually feel like i'm lying to people if i don't let them know about this kind of fucked up past i've had. This post doesn't cover the timeline of my rebellion (very obviously because of depression as a young teen), but I dont think thats necessary right now. I feel like I could be doing so much more if I hadn't let one boy get to me in high school, or obsess over some emotionally fucked up chick in high school and romanticize depression to the point where I actually started having it. 

All in all, I undestand I fucked up. And I need someone's genuine, non-judgmental opinion. I always always mean well. I never want to hurt anyone, but I don't feel loved. And relationships have been broken because of the fact that I didn't love myself enough to maturely continue them. 

I love y'all. Everyone in this kind  community. But I wish I could say that about myself too. How do you even love yourself when you've genuinely, genuinely fucked up many good things? Help. ",shiyubenza,1
2017-02-07 01:29:08,reddit_comment,"I like what you said about ""self-helping yourself"" -- that's a huge step in dealing with anxiety and depression. I would recommend going to the library and checking out their self help books, because buying them can prove to be a bust, as many can be corny and cliche. I understand your feeling of not feeling good enough and not wanting to be yourself in fear of people not liking who you really are. But fuck everyone else. If you're not yourself, you're never really going to like yourself, because you're not being genuine and honest with yourself. That's the first step...do what you want, say what you want (to an extent lol), wear what you want...and if the people in your life now leave because you showed them your true self, you don't want them in your life anyway.

My anxiety feels like constant FOMO lately. There's always this voice in my head that tells me how I'm failing. I was out with my mum and aunt the other night and it just kept saying; ""everyone is here with their friends. You're here with your mum and aunt because they feel sorry for you. You don't have any friends"". It's true, I've pushed people away and I am lonely, but I'm trying. It doesn't matter what I do, it's there. I can't write a simple email without asking myself a million questions and wondering if the person even likes me. I try to chill on the weekend myself and watch films and the voice just keeps saying: ""what else can you do? You have no one to hang out with anyway"".

I'm trying to date, but the voice just keeps reminding me that I'm 25 and I have no real dating experience, so how am I meant to do it right? I have a weight problem and I've been eating better and trying to exercise but it just keeps saying ""you won't find anyone till you're skinny.

The truth is, I rely on my friends far too much for entertainment and company when I feel that I should be more comfortable doing things on my own. For instance, I hear stories of friends who have traveled alone or who plan on traveling alone for extended periods of time, which all seems incredibly brave to me. Even hearing stories of people attending concerts by themselves is very impressive. But I can't see myself taking the necessary steps to committing to such a strong act of independence. My reliance on my friends' company is evident on a daily basis -- I enjoy spending time with my family, but I always feel like I need to see my friends at least once per day. Not only that, but I value my friends' opinions too much, often more than my own (this is something I'm working on by reminding myself that my opinion is important in situations where I may have been too sensitive to theirs).

I'm often overwhelmed by social situations - very many things that I try to control, and I'm afraid of saying bad things, of offending people, and of missing opportunities (especially now that I'm single).

That's why I'm afraid of a party that I organised for tomorrow. It will be a before-before New year's eve party, and I expect around 10-15 people to come.

- Usually everyone wants to talk to me - and I don't have the time to talk with everyone all the time.
- For ""political reasons"" I invited one or two people who I don't like that much, and who usually talk too much to me. On bigger parties I'd just avoid them, but it's harder in such a small environment. I'm afraid they will notice that I don't like them that much :(
- Girls! There will be one girl I really like and want to date in January. There will be one girl that would like to date me, but I'm not interested (invited for ""political reasons""). There is one girl that I'm kinda FWB with. And one couple that I think is in an open relationship and I wouldn't mind joining. Who do I flirt with? How do I avoid that one girl?
- Also, I don't know which party to choose after mine is done. With whom I go? Do I go with some people first, and then switch to another party? Usually in situations like these I stress all the time, I've got serious FOMO, and end up having no fun in one place, and then little fun in another.

I work at a sports bar restaurant, have been working there almost a year now, and lately have just been getting scheduled weekends out the ass.

I‚Äôm a 24yo woman from Chicago, IL who‚Äôs never traveled outside of the U.S, and something about that makes me feel really shitty about myself to be honest.  I‚Äôve always wanted to travel abroad and see other parts of the world, but never had the opportunity or financial means to do so. I‚Äôve traveled domestically, but can only count on one hand the amount of times I‚Äôve done that, and even with my domestic travels I‚Äôve hardly ever left the midwest. As a minor, I had a mother who would travel abroad to various countries annually with her bf, but never took me or any of my siblings with her. She then would return from her travels bragging and boasting to all of her friends, in front of her children mind you, about how much fun she had and how ‚Äúup‚Äù she was if you will. Once I reached 18, I didn‚Äôt have any financial support from my parents and had to fend for myself in order to make ends meet, which is extremely difficult when you‚Äôre trying to juggle going to school full time. So as a result, my financial circumstances has been yet another barrier in why I haven‚Äôt traveled abroad. Where the fomo comes in is I don‚Äôt want to leave this world having only seen and touched a small part of it.

I also experiance a lot of fomo when I look at other people my age on social media who travel abroad multiple times a year with ease. Like how are they able to afford all of that without struggling? I know that it isn‚Äôt good to compare my journey to others, and that ‚Äúmy time will come‚Äù blas√® blas√®, but I honestly feel like that isn‚Äôt enough to soothe the feelings of inadequacy I have when it comes to that area of my life.

It's easier if you go with a group of friends and split the costs. You want to pick flights that are low cost. Find a nice Airbnb to stay in and split that cost. Avoid expensive touristy restaurants. If you go with 3-5 people you might get a nice 4 day vacation for $500, ballpark. Your experience may vary.¬†

Just because you aren't attending lectures doesn't mean you can't be in the same friend group and hang out away from class. You aren't going to be playing beer pong and having sex in physics. Nothing stopping you from having the same if not better experiences. Have you considered doing something crazy and something likely to make your friends think ""damn that's cool I wish I was doing that"".,....traveling? Can guarantee something like that would generate some insane time.  

What about working in the student bars/clubs. When working you'll be able to chat and meet people and then off shift you can have drinks with them (if the place doesn't allow staff to drink, I know some places allow it to loosen up the bar staff) 

I could waffle on but my point is you have the ability to change this, do something to alter the direction.  

Your only limit......",evasivesnail,1

2024-06-10 21:27:33,reddit_post,"How to deal with FOMO even for things you don't necessarily WANT to do? So this might sound like a bit of a dumb thing to struggle with, but I've struggled with it for years and I feel like it's beginning to take over my life. Essentially, FOMO has got the better of me, to the point that I'll even talk myself into doing things I'm not really that interested in doing. 

For example, it might be something as small as going for a drink with friends after work, or something bigger like going to a music festival. The reasons for not going range from just being tired and wanting to go and collapse after work, to just having some bad experiences with attending music festivals in the past and not wanting to have to go through it again.

In my head, I know I should just say ""no, but thanks for the offer."" But I find it so difficult to accept that I might miss out on a funny moment, not be included in future plans, or that my friends might talk ill of me behind my back, that I end up caving and doing it anyway. I also argue that because I'm admittedly a bit more introverted and recharge my social battery by being on my own, making myself go out and go for drinks etc. is something I should do to push myself out of my comfort zone a little more.

It's reached the point where I've turned down going to see my partner's family for a weekend or going on holiday in fear of missing out on a single night out. 

I think there's probably some childhood trauma of bullying/ being left out playing a part here (for some reason, when I was younger I didn't get invited to some kid's pool party despite being in that friendship group). I know I've got insecurities, and I'm trying to just push through the FOMO and accept that it's going to happen. I hate how it makes me feel, but I hate knowing I'm missing out on living my own life and being there for other important people in my life. 

I know this probably reads a little jumbled and unclear, but that's how my head constantly feels nowadays and I think it's this chronic overthinking and FOMO that play the biggest part in it.

Any help appreciated, and sorry again if it reads a little jumbled.",AlteriorVortex,1

2024-04-19 20:37:36,reddit_post,"Do you think you would have FOMO if you closed out all of your social media? I closed out all of my SM on February 20th..  I have since opened a reddit account on April 1, 20224 but this is annomonus....

February 20th I closed out my Facebook, Twitter, Instagram - anything that had ""friends"" and my name attrached to it, I got rid of. In fact, I even got a new phone at that time and with it, a new number. I only shared that number with my employer and my elderly parents. 

I didn't make an announcement. Nothing says cringe more than posting on Facebook that you're closing out your Facebook account. I've never known anyone to succeed at that. The people who do well without Facebook likely never had a Facebook presence anyways. 

Why do it? Two reasons - the first was it seemed like every time I vented about something in my own life - it was met with either people thinking the post was directed at them or weirdly attacked me (my own family and friends) For example, my expensive bike was stolen from inside my apartment - I posted that bc I had video of this person and the low life is on probation as it is, this would be a simple police report to file and investigate. One person said, I should just accept the loss and move on - another said ""It's people like you that ruin cities like ours and like San Francisco."" What?!? And this was a friend of mine and my parents and siblings. You file a police report so that people who are considering buying a home in the area have an accurate idea of crime. You file a police report when a crime happens so that your city knows where to spend it's resources. Plus, I still don't understand what they meant by San Francisco. This lead me to my second reason for going offline - your online presence is not real. Take the bike for example. People looking at my life think I have it easy- I make good money. It's just a bike. What they don't know is that it was my transportation. I have panic attacks and they are worse when I drive. I don't talk about it and I don't share that I don't have a car any more bc it was too much stress for me. So people think I just bike for fun and not bc I need it to get around. And why don't I talk about my anxiety and panic attacks? Well, I did once and ""friends"" asked ""why does a cis white male even have panic attacks?"" 

Am I happier now that I can't be found online? Not happy but I'm no longer disappointed by people I considered to be friends. I do have FOMO. I fear the death of someone I know or their family members and it would be something I would want to know about. So...  somewhat.

2024-03-22 01:30:02,reddit_post,"FOMO based on past bullying Hi everyone, I just want to share the way I experience FOMO related to being bullied as a kid. 

Where some people might feel it as not wanting to miss out on good experiences, I have a more negative reason behind mine. When I was 13/14, I was bullied on my school bus, and it all came to a head when one day i arrived late to the bus and, out of the blue, all the kids decided suddenly to stop talking to me and leave me out of all conversation. One of the kids was my childhood best friend who just turned on me like that and we never spoke again to this day.  

I remember having this idea that if I'd not been late that day, none of it would have happened. And so nowadays, when I see my friends meeting up and I can't make it for whatever reason, I get so anxious that they'll somehow realise that they don't actually want me around and never talk to me again or that they'll have such an amazing bonding experience that they just won't be able to relate to me anymore. Basically, I worry that in during a meetup I'm not attending my friends will collectivly decide to stop talking to me. Though I know it's so unlikely, my mind struggles to rest until I hear from one of them the next day about it. 

I felt it would be good to share this somewhere as I have felt too much shame to even share this with my best friends and please let me know if you have experienced similar. Thanks!",ryzio270,1

Friendship is often a problem with depression. It's not that friends don't care. It's that they simply don't know what to say. 

  
A lot of people are into journaling. If you do this, it's a good idea to emphasize your successes and take little notice of your failures. If other people are not patting us on the back, we have to do it ourselves.  
  
Note your past successes and the ones your having these days. Remember who you are and see the positive things you're doing now.  
  
One of the most interesting things I know about this is a New York Times article ""What's All This About Journaling?"" The author of the Times article says that she has been very happy using the approach to journaling recommended by self-help author Julia Cameron, which is writing three longhand, stream of consciousness pages right after waking up. Stream of consciousness - just writing whatever pops into your head at the moment. The Times author said that this is therapeutic and helps her with solving problems.",RWPossum,2

Basically, I‚Äôve (20M) been struggling with my mental health for a while (depression and anxiety), and this semester of college has been really rough. Between classes and my job and homework I‚Äôve been incredibly overwhelmed with little to no time to relax or do things I enjoy, like video games or reading.

The only time I do have is on the weekends. I never have assignments due Fridays or Saturdays, so I don‚Äôt have to worry about school on the weekends. The problem is, I have a really close group of 3 friends. Since starting college 2 years ago, we‚Äôve seen each other more than I‚Äôve seen any person in my life besides my parents, often due to the fact that we hang out every weekend, all weekend (and a lot of the week as well).

You can probably see where I‚Äôm going with this. I desperately need time for myself, because my mental health is really suffering without it. But at the same time, I get *extreme* FOMO when my friends hang out without me. It‚Äôs such a small group that every time I‚Äôve had to miss a movie night or dinner plans, there‚Äôs pictures posted and new inside jokes that just make me feel bad to be left out of.

My therapist said that I just have to practice exposure therapy and just not hang out sometimes, but it‚Äôs been really difficult and is only making my mental health worse. Has anyone else had to deal with intense FOMO before? Did anything help you get over it?",throwaway175932,2

Normally I wouldn't care because I haven't seen them, or if I have I didn't know it was from the battle pass.

My bf showed my one of his skins that he has. It's like a little kitty piloting a robot.

2023-02-02 18:31:41,reddit_post,"Advice/help - am I purposefully isolating? or is it social pressure/FOMO? Hey everyone, I hope you're all doing well:))

I have a short question regarding self-isolation vs self-care (if that makes sense).

4 months ago, I decided to take the drastic step of going to the gym because I was so done with my self-esteem issues. I know I was doing my body a disservice and decided to do my best (I couldn't even do a single push-up). Because I prioritize uni and training, I have stopped going out completely (no heavy drinking, partying, etc.) and generally only meet with a couple of friends (3-4) to have a coffee/go out for dinner. I also stopped going on any social media at all (God that was a hard af step), because it really affected my mood and FOMO:(

These steps were super hard for me to do & I really had a lot of struggles and fallbacks but I managed to hold out until now.

I've noticed I am eating better, getting better sleep, am in no drama at all at uni, and getting all my work done. My anxiety regarding uni (passing exams, etc.) has really significantly decreased, and I'm really, really grateful for that. My gym training abilities also are going great, which I am super proud of (I finally can do pushups!:))

I am pretty young still, so a lot of people at uni started to look at me weirdly for not jumping at any opportunity to go out drinking like I used to. A lot of people who I have kinda 'cut out' are starting to approach me asking why I am not hanging out. Some (who I don't even know well), told me that I should stop 'self-isolating' and have 'more fun' and not be as stuck up...I was really shocked at this because I don't even know these people properly. 

That's why I decided to come on here and ask if my behaviour is self-destructing? Or am I doing ok? I really felt happy with the changes I've been doing, but since I've been getting this reaction from people I know and even strangers, maybe there's something to it. This whole thing doesn't help my FOMO either, so I'm kinda concerned:(

    I‚Äôm 18 years old, and i have more than enough      traits to be sure that i have ADHD.
I don‚Äôt know if its related to what I‚Äôm about to say, but just wanted to make it clear.

I‚Äôm currently in a state where i need more information, as a drop out, i was very desperate to pursue self education, mainly to be self employed and become an entrepreneur.
   By a matter of luck, stars allining and something else, i became a self employed baker, but i feel like i‚Äôm stuck.
  I experience very tough FOMO when i think about social media use for business, and my appearence, i feel fear but at the same time my personality is completely opposite. Most of the time i‚Äôm very self-confident and willing to do work that needs to be done, but in case of scaling up i cant resist that FOMO.
    I also tend to periodically forget everything i learned in terms of my interests, just out of nowhere, my brain feels empty and i feel scared because I‚Äôm being mediocre despite the things i tend to learn. It feels like it just slips past my brain. 
   But then it comes back! When i experience a dopamine rush from natural consequences, my brain starts working really well, and puts puzzles out of my knowledge i could never imagine.
   Thanks to everybody that read this, i post this out of desperation, i couldnt find anything about this beyond the ‚ÄúBrain Fog‚Äù which is much more on the surface than my problem.

It used to be crippling, hindering me everyday. After crying literally every time I opened Instagram or any other social media site because I saw other people participating in events‚Äî going to theme parks, celebrating birthdays‚Äî I had to quit for a couple years. Hell, I had to stop going on YouTube for the same reason.
When I was 11, I started being able see others doing things that I wasn't ever able to go to without immediately balling my brains out.

But, I've tried everything to get better, and nothing will work. And now, at the age of 14, I'll give you an instance of my usual, I guess you could call it an episode.
Ranboo, a YouTuber and Twitch Streamer (who uses he/they pronouns but I'm going to use he/him for consistency, and also the fact that I'm not doing too well and this is all hastily typed at 1:25am), did a lot in the time that I didn't have a phone. All that, I was excited for, happy and glad it all happened, as I watched in his recap.
Then he started talking about when he went to vidcon, and I started to feel the normal feeling of being bummed it because, obviously, I couldn't and might not ever be able to attend it.
But then he mentioned that he came out as gay and non-binary. And initially, I was glad for him. Happy and glad that he got to feel more comfortable, and be upfront with his fans.
And then it kinda just all hit me. Like, the fact that I'd continue to miss out bc I don't have stable internet connection on my phone, and the fact that I missed out on the feeling of seeing the notification of his silly tweets like ""I like men"". And I started crying.

Yeah, I've heard of fomo, but this isn't it. I've gotten over the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of parties every hour that I won't ever be able to be apart of as much as I got over that I can't be a princess. But I don't want just a recap of an event, even though I do. I want to experience it in real time, and for that reason alone I still haven't watched a second of ""Who Killed Markiplier"".

Does anyone know what can be wrong with me? I will give any elaboration asked.",Heat_ot_Moment,3

For the past year I've had a very close relationship with some people online, and we talk all the time and have shared a lot of moments that are highlights in my life, real life stuff too. Anyway, Whenever I see that my friends are doing something or talking, I have the need to drop everything and join. I have neglected my health and responsivities in the past from this. And lately, I did something really stupid. I started a new job and it was my 2nd week, I saw my friends talking on my phone and just walked out without saying anything, got in my car and left. I knew before during and after how stupid it was, but not doing it was giving me actual crippling anxiety so did it anyway. Idk if this is some legit issue or I'm actually just a spastic loser. I have hobbies and am physically healthy etc, but this is really fucking up my life. Every decision I make about my future plans or anything, my first consideration is my friends. They feel like the biggest and most important thing in my life. Entertaining the idea of them not being a part of my life depresses me immensely so I don't really put myself first.

2022-03-14 05:48:49,reddit_post,"I'm actively experiencing FOMO and nothing on the internet is helping me The long and short of it is that I have really negative reactions when I find out people are enjoying time together without me. I try really hard to be happy for them and not ruin their day by bitching about not being invited, but that results in me sitting alone while everyone else is making memories together. It's gotten to a point where I would be invited to things and say no, specifically because I thought they were only inviting me out of pity and they would have more fun without me. This resulted in my friends not really inviting me to anything anymore.   


Right now, all of my college friends are spending their spring break together in Nashville, while I sit in my room alone. None of them let me know it was happening.  


It makes things worse than they all live together and I live in an apartment by myself because there are no 5-person apartments on campus. Again, I really am not trying to hold it against them because I know that it will push them away more..... but I starting to get the feeling of those anxiety-like panic attacks I experience sometimes and I don't know what to do.   


Since I can't afford a therapist and am not exactly looking for medicine for this stupid shit, I decided to try and find some kind of community in this because **this is so isolating.** I went through some Reddit posts, and while there are a lot of people experiencing this it doesn't seem like anyone offers to help. I then turned to Google, and practically every article is just *""get off of social media because it warps perception.""*

&#x200B;

My FOMO doesn't come from seeing people's Instagram posts. It comes from myself not being chill enough for my friends to invite me to things and convincing them I never want to hang out when that's all I actually want. 

&#x200B;

I want to find a way to get better. I want to be a good friend and be invited to things again. I have been reaching out all semester and inviting them to things, but it doesn't stop the pain of knowing that I am going to be missing out on some of their favorite college experiences. They are so much closer to each other than me, and I caused that. If anyone knows a way I can navigate this and actually repair myself (not just the unplugging mumbo jumbo), I really need to hear it. And if you read all this for some crazy reason, thank you. I know a million people are constantly complaining about their mental health, so the fact you felt like reading mine means a lot

2021-05-15 04:02:56,reddit_post,"Are you dealing with FOMO anxiety and need some tips to cope? The feeling of FOMO, or fear of missing out, is an anxiety that many people suffer from. Typically when you feel this way, you are worried about the opportunities that are passing you by because you aren't doing anything with your time. This can lead to a lot of stress and even depression. 

**However, there are ways to deal with it so that it doesn't get worse.**

*Research shows that a fear of missing out can stem from unhappiness and dissatisfaction with life and that these feelings can propel us into greater social media usage.*

In turn, greater engagement with social media can make us feel worse about ourselves and our lives. In this way, it helps to know that our attempts to alleviate feelings of FOMO by engaging more on Facebook or Instagram can actually lead us down a rabbit hole into feeling even less self-accepting than before! It's important then develop strategies for dealing with the problem in order not to experience those same negative emotions over time.

**1. Change your focus.** 

When you're feeling down or uninspired, try a little mind shift. Rather than focusing on what we lack, let's notice the many things that are already in our lives to be grateful for! It may not feel like it at first when your social media feed is full of people who have more time and money than us bragging about their latest vacations--but with some effort, anyone can make changes to get back into the groove. Add positive friends; block out those others less supportive (or worse: negative). Ignore them by scrolling past before they start making you feel worse instead of better!

**2. Keep a Journal**

It is common to post on social media to keep a record of the fun things you do. However, you may find yourself noticing a little too much about whether people are validating your experiences online. If this is the case, you may want to take some of your photos and memories offline and keep a personal journal of your best memories, either online or on paper.

Keeping a journal can help us move away from our focus on public approval into a private appreciation for what makes life great; which may, in turn, get out of cycles like social media.

**3. Seek Out Real Connections.**

When we feel lonely or excluded, our brain is trying to tell us that it needs more connections with people and a greater sense of belonging at its core. It is actually healthy to seek out more connections with others and increase our sense of belonging. It may sound like the ultimate catch-22 but in reality, this human need has been around for centuries before there were even people on Earth!

Making plans with a good friend, creating a group outing, or doing anything social that gets you out with friends can be a nice change of pace. It puts the focus on what matters most to you and makes it feel like your life has some forward momentum again.

**4. Focus on Gratitude** 

Take some time out of your day and pick a person or thing in which you find gratitude, then write it down on paper. Afterward, take the list that you wrote them down on and go around telling people what they are thankful for about these things! It's amazing how much this can bring up happiness within an individual as well as those who were told by someone else what is great about their life too!

**It's normal to experience FOMO, but we should take actions to deal with it**.

If any of these tactics sound helpful but still feel overwhelming, reach out for help! I'd love to chat with you one-on-one and see how we can get you back on track so that you don‚Äôt let FOMO dictate where your time goes. Just text me and I would be more than happy to schedule a call with you (it's free).

I'm sure  Everyone feels a certain level of FOMO at different times in their lives.
an anxious feeling you get when you feel other people might be having a good time without you.

So what does FOMO actually mean from a psychological perspective? 
is it a form of cognitive distortion?

I hope this video helps you acknowledge this feeling from a different perspective and adds value to this group

2020-12-29 16:52:04,reddit_post,"I think that fear of missing out (FOMO) in this advancing and highly-fast paced world of today, whether it is in cinema, TV, literature and so on, is a real phenomenon and I think that not enough people are talking about it Please bear in mind that I do not have any actual scientific proof to back up this claim so please take it with a pinch of salt.

In the world of today, we live in an era of abundance and/or excess, with an advancement that is so fast-paced that the rate keeps on skyrocketing by the second.

In the world of today, things are much more accessible, available and more possible than ever:

* Things can be accessed, stored and transferred in the blink of an eye and the world of today is literally swimming in an ocean of information (which is why it is called the information era)
* With the technology and the level of understanding of many things today, things can be made in a short period of time ‚Äì machines making thousands or even millions of products and pumping them out and great quantities
* And with the level of globalisation that we are in today, there are simultaneously many things and places around the world that are simultaneously expanding, advancing, producing, and doing and reacting in any way, place and form

This, of course, gives us a lot more room for variety and many things are of various degrees in quality, taste and so on.

&#x200B;

But then you will realise something.

You go to a video game store like Steam or go on Netflix, or a library, and you see all of these options.

&#x200B;

And to add to that, these lists often change as the algorithms are often updated, whether it is because of ongoing trends or things that fit in your recent activity or what you saw yesterday or better yet, what you did a Google search on yesterday or what you said on your smartphone microphone.

And to even add another thing to this, multiple¬†things are often constantly being updated and/or advance as well ‚Äì new TV episodes, sequels and prequels of stories, books, video games, or the current ongoing trends and discussions of every single fandom or news are constantly being updated like a Reddit thread that gets longer each time you refresh the page ‚Äì then add that to multiple threads being extended ‚Ä¶ and to add another layer to this, sometimes the home page even changes so may not always get the same list of contents twice on the main page.

&#x200B;

According to my understanding of human attention and memory, a human being can only do so much ‚Äì we have a limited attention span, our minds (while very capable and versatile) is limited in their brainpower, and to switch and shift from one subject to another is not really an easy thing to do (imagine switching subjects in a school in a short amount of time), let alone having to go deeper within each subject and hoping that the level inside your brain, whether it is knowledge or mental skill or attention or understanding, increases as well which also takes time, effort and a lot of mental and physical attention.

It is as though we are¬†given a lot of stuff that we can choose from like being in a candy store where there are also other kinds of candy stores and even other fancy stores around, where each one is filled to the prime with all kinds of delicacies and treats ‚Ä¶ but we can only buy or consume so much at a given rate, especially when we are told that these things may either get sold out or expire or die out because of changing trends.

It is like a bottleneck effect where we want to get all of the things and these things have a limited lifespan before their quality are deemed as good or relevant.

&#x200B;

Now, you might say that this is all a thing in the mind and maybe so.

Perhaps this is all done via unconscious social means because of peer pressure and you are anxious to consume these things like everyone else is so that you do not miss out on the fun but you miss out on other things or not be as immersed because you are doing it because you are pressured to do so and not because you want to.

Or it could be a psychological issue because you have lots of interests and hobbies and needs but can only do so much at any given rate similar to having an 8-hour shift where the lists of tasks are either increasing or updating and so on. Let alone that we currently live in an era that we constantly bombarded with stimulation and/or the need for stimulation and information over and over and over again with that constant feed and need of dopamine without rest or pause.

&#x200B;

**TLDR - I think that this is a real issue in the world of today, whether it is video games, TV, film, art, books, education, news, etc because many of us have lots of interests, whether it is in multiple subjects like you could be an artist and a banker; and/or interests in multiple creative entities in a particular thing like you can be a fan of multiple franchises and fandoms.**

**And I think that this is not only unhealthy for all of us but also something that is not talked about a lot or not discussed thoroughly on how to tackle this as the world keeps on advancing and producing and so on**",sammyjamez,4

I regularly meet friends 1:1 and organise virtual meetups, but I feel like it's not enough. Lately I have been having fear of missing out. I know some of my friends gather in other people's houses (this is not allowed in Scotland, UK) and it makes me sad. I wish I could join them but I would feel super anxious and I want to think that rules are there for a reason. Is anyone else also conflicted?

2020-01-03 20:22:44,reddit_post,"My FOMO is starting to eat me alive Hi everyone. I need to vent on something.

I have hardcore ""FOMO"" as I heard it, or, ""Fear of Missing Out"", that means I'm always afraid of missing stuff that could be happening while I'm not here.

I think nearly everyone can feel this way sometimes, frustration when you miss out on a great time. But I think in my case it can be unhealthy.

For example, everytime there's a night out with my friends, I'm one of the few that goes to bed at 5-6 AM. So everyone sees me as this ""party hard guy""... Well in 90% of those parties I've wanted to leave since midnight and go to my goddamn couch, and I go through the party with a hole in my stomach and I'm pissed when everyone orders an other drink. But I just can't leave because I don't want to miss out...

Recent example, a few days ago I was with my family for Christmas. I was SO HAPPY to see them because I see them like once or twice a year... But while I was with them I saw an Instagram story where my friends were having drinks. Just that. Not a specific party, not a special occasion, just having casual drinks like we do at least twice a week. And it was enough to, again, put a hole in my stomach and I couldn't enjoy my afternoon with my family and play with my nephew (which I love to do). Of course when they asked me why I was feeling so bad and looking so depressed I couldn't tell them, that would sound so ridiculous...

So I don't know what should I do to fix it...

Am I the only one with the same problem?",Fraestro6,14
2020-01-03 21:10:46,reddit_comment,"If you're in therapy, this could be a good thing to discuss with your therapist. 

What works for me is to realise that no matter what, you're missing out on something. You will always miss out on something, but that's life. Right now you're missing out on scuba diving, and camel-riding, and eating a meal with locals in rural China, because you've chosen to live your current life instead. The same concept applies to friends/family events: when you miss out on drinks with your friends, you gain time to relax or time to enjoy your family. If you go out with your friends, you miss out relaxation, or you miss out on enjoying family time. 

The important part is to think: Which things are most important to you? Then you choose which one to do and which one to miss out on based on what things matter most to you. Maybe going out with your friends is *usually* more important, but for major family events you still want to be there to demonstrate you value your family as well. Or maybe you want to be at home most of the time, but for major nights out with friends you still want to be there. Or maybe you want it to be a roughly 50/50 split. Etc. Pick what you want to do based on what matters most to you, then do it.",iostefini,8
2020-01-04 01:44:16,reddit_comment,"All right, so this might be some weird advice to give, but I can totally relate and this has always helped me deal with FOMO. I lived in Japan for three years and Thailand for one, leaving my friend groups behind to go seek some adventure. Trust me, whenever I was on social media, I'd have a pang of sadness feeling like I was missing out on spending a night out with my friends. What really helped? 

A Frat President's speech.

I'm acutely aware how bizarre that sounds, but hopefully this helps you as much as it did me. 

The basic message of the speech:

""In my five years of college, it took me two years to realize that the parties were all the same. They happened three times a week, and yet ALL of them end up the same. You and your boys get drunk, funny shit happens, music plays, all a good time. But that test that you have to study for? That's more important. Graduating college is more important. Spending time with your partner is more important. So don't ever feel like you're missing out on a party because you have to study or see your family or take some time for yourself; the party will be here next week, and the next, and the next, and I PROMISE YOU, the shit you think you're missing out on is always waiting for you again. Never forget what's important in life. There'll always be another party.""

I came back after about five years abroad, and though I obviously missed out on some good times, talks, and memories, compared to the experiences I had in Asia, I never regret it. We picked right back up where we left off, and I've enjoyed plenty of nights out with them since.

I'm sure you'll have plenty of happy memories with your friends, but you have to take care of you first. Sleep well, see your family, enjoy your friends without thinking of seeing them as an ""obligation"". (not saying you do, just using the word to help set a point) I assure you that if they're good friends(I'm sure they are), they'd prefer you happier! 

Hope this helps, and thanks a lot for posting. Take care!",Reviryu,1

I'm going into my final year of university in late September and although my university is quite small in terms of student numbers, and they've said that they'd prefer for their classes to be in person, there's a chance that my classes could be reduced to online only.

I was a middle child so I always felt like my older siblings got to do cool older things and my younger sister got to do be carefree with no responsibilities and it always felt like it set my brain up to want to do everything and feeling hurt if people didn‚Äôt invite me.

As time has passed I‚Äôve continued to focus on relationships that reciprocate and finding value in that. Those relationships for me tend to be more fulfilling and add more to my life when otherwise i was feeling left out or not good enough or something.

She has a great job, pays well, we have a nice apartment, our relationship is a loving one. Outside of work our social circle is wide and we do attend and have interesting hobbies albeit somewhat alternative to social norms. However my gf feels like she is constantly missing out on things.

Like there is always a great need in her to attend various music events and sometimes I feel like this overtakes the joy of experiencing the present. She seems to be in a constant rush to do lots of things because she says she feels her life isn't interesting enough.

In the midst of all this rush often things at present do get a little messy (eg:daily chores not done) and for me it's rather tiring to keep up with one new thing after another with her.

How do I tell her to slow down and enjoy the moment?

2024-11-25 05:31:55,reddit_post,"looking for advice hi everyone. I've been having some hard times and wanted to vent a little. 

I also have a serious question but let me vent a little first. and by a little I mean for a while, this will take some time so hang tight. 

for the longest time I have been dealing with the loneliness and some form of dissasosiation from my surroundings. only times that I dont feel these feelings are the moments that I'm so focused on a hobby of mine and I dont have time to feel anything else. at first I thought these were my 30's blues or whatever. but seeing some old pictures reminded me of how carefree I was. 

the thing is technically I have no particular reason to feel hopeless or whatever. in the last 3 years I've managed to

1 succesfully reorganized our chores and family job with my family so we can get rid of old depts and relatives who just use us

2 finally made some savings for our future; we've turned a net negative situation into a net positive, seriously I'm so proud of us. 

3 finally got everything I wanted for so long but wasnt really able to spare budget. and on top of that I've learned so much about these stuff (headphones IEM's laptops etc) I can confidently ignore all the FOMO inducing stuff. 

so technically  I should have inner peace. 

but I cant relax for a reason. I feel like distant from my surroundings and my family. 

I cant put words for it. 

  
the thing is I tried to reach out to a therapist and she somehow managed to made it worse with her supergeneric cookie cutter responses. 

I dont want to relive that again... 

  
you know what I think I should make another post for this question.... 

I could use your comments.

I have noticed that most of the things you mention in your post are of a material nature. Money, buisiness, tech. 
But what about the immaterial. What do you really want? What does it mean to feel fulfilled for you? Do you have dreams or goals? You mention you are proud. But you used the term 'us'. Does that mean you are also proud of yourself? 

Inner peace is (in my humble opinion) reached when we are satisfied with both the material and immaterial things we have. So it may be the case that you need to find a goal to love forward to. One that is just for you.

but in the meantime I've ignored my mental health for too long. I havent made new connections with anyone new at all. 

the thing is I'm a hard person to connect because of my tendency to overanalyze and overthink. I dont stress things out but I also cannot feel connected over trivial things.

2024-10-19 09:59:32,reddit_post,"Am I (aromantic) or just emotionally unavailable? 23M. I‚Äôve never had a relationship in my life. I always thought relationships were a waste of time growing up and I cringe pretty hard at them, especially the ones on TikTok. But I‚Äôve always had crushes on women. The crushes were more of like a school type crush (something about them interested me and I would like thinking about them). Thinking about such person would make me feel nice, but I never actually wanted to approach them because I found dating to be a waste of time and wanted to focus on my academics.

First date I ever went on was when I was 18 and I‚Äôll be real, I didn‚Äôt like it. It felt awkward and she had a great time. I was feeling suffocated so I called things off and asked for a friendship. She didn‚Äôt want that so we stopped talking.

Whenever I kiss or make out with women, I don‚Äôt really feel sparks or that passion. I‚Äôve never loved anyone and the closest I‚Äôve ever loved someone was me being attached to someone who gave me mixed signals (hot and cold energy) as ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. I asked if they wanted to be official not because I actually wanted to date them but because I felt like it was the right thing to do? To be on the same page on not in a situationship? Whenever I have a crush on someone, I imagine me talking to them and being their friend, not me having sexual relations with them or making out with them. It‚Äôs always like: ‚ÄúI want to get to know that person more. But a date? Hell no, I don‚Äôt want a date‚Äù I hate dating. I hate dates. They feel forced and unnatural to me, like job interviews. I don‚Äôt like going on dates period.

But one day it would be ‚Äúnice‚Äù to be in a relationship no? Isn‚Äôt that what society expects of me? I can befriend people I‚Äôm physically attracted to, yet apparently I see people online saying that it‚Äôs ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù for them to do so. But I want a genuine friendship with them, not court them? But I get FOMO in that, ‚Äúbut what if I do like them and would like to date them later on? Or what if they like me and I‚Äôm missing an opportunity by not giving them a chance?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm asexual because I have sexual attraction to women. I have a fearful avoidant attachment style and I thought me ending things was because I was afraid of commitment for feeling engulfed and losing my independence, because I do worry about a relationship with said ‚Äúcrushes‚Äù when I think about what a relationship with them would entail: ‚Äúacting all lovey dovey, going on dates, holding hands, etc.‚Äù - kinda makes me a bit cringe. But I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm scared of it? Like I‚Äôm not scared of getting hurt. I just feel like I‚Äôm not into dating? At least society‚Äôs way? I keep hearing: ‚Äúoh but you haven‚Äôt met the right person‚Äù and I wonder if I‚Äôll ever get that click with someone. I always thought I‚Äôd have to really know someone and grow to love them with time, but I guess I‚Äôve never really allowed it to happen. I wonder if it will

My mental health has never been terrible, (growing up I struggled with anxiety only, especially health anxiety). I never wanted to stay at home for school but in senior year I was pressured by my parents and brother to stay here and save money. They‚Äôre traditional middle eastern and probably thought I‚Äôd be partying like crazy over there. Moving away for school has been something I‚Äôve wanted to do since 9th grade. I enjoy being involved in school clubs/activities, like to try new things explore new cities, etc. the campus college experience is exactly what I wanted as a little girl all the way up until 12th grade when I was shut down. As I did get older I got less and less freedom to go out from my parents, so moving away would‚Äôve given me that. At the beginning of my university journey I started dating a boy and my brother cut off all communication with me. Things were hectic at home as my parents were taking my brothers side. Soon enough  I‚Äôd dread coming home and instead would spend long hours at the university because they couldn‚Äôt get mad at me for studying. My anxiety was worse than ever, and when my aunt passed away halfway through my first year, I experienced depression. Depression so bad I had no motivation for living I just could not see the point of it. My sweet boyfriend would support me all he could and without him I don‚Äôt know what I would do. He reminded me it would just be a wave that would pass by and soon things would be okay, slowly but surely. Things got better with my depression, but they never got better with my family I‚Äôve just had to live with the awkwardness of them hating that I have a boyfriend and feeling like I‚Äôm on a wrong path. My summer was ruined because I was filled with anxiety any time i would want to go out at night. End of august rolls around and my best friend is off to university of Michigan again and my other friend back in Toronto living in a skyscraper of a dorm. I feel deep rooted fomo (fear of missing out) and jealousy towards them. Anytime I see a snap they post my body gets this depressed feeling again. I wasn‚Äôt sure why until I talked it out with my boyfriend and realized it was rooted in me wanting to go away. Everyday recently I‚Äôve been waking up feeling dreaded to start my day and overall unhappy with my decision of staying home.

Need your opinion or help with the following conditions:
I am 30M, having chest tightness and lump in throat (crying feeling in throat). This is not 24*7, but I will have one of them for major part of day. I don't have any repeatative thoughts or any other major anxiety symptoms. Life seems pretty chill with decent job and everything is going well (nothing to be concerned about), still not able to understand the reason of this anxiety.

Same thing happened last year and it lasted for 6 months without help of any medication, same time of the year. Same happened year before also, but got cured with panex 25 (consumed it for 4months and left abruptly).
This all started 2 years ago but at that time I had fomo since I was in bschool and studying from home. So my first term was shit because of anxiety. As soon as I entered campus, it was like nothing happened and I just moved on without any help or medication.

Not sure about the reasons for the anxiety after that episode since everything is going well. I am not sure whether to consult any doctor or not. I feel irritated sometimes. Can someone shed light on what exactly this could be?

2024-07-15 04:43:31,reddit_post,"Need critical help about my problems in career/happiness I am 21M in pursuing engineering, I have a huge problem and I want some advice. Sorry in advance for my English, it's not my first language.  
I always feel the amalgamation of all these emotions below but I know it's just one feeling of extreme jealousy/fear of something that I can‚Äôt exactly put my finger on:

1. The inferiority complex, like why am I not like that x person, he is so good I can never be like him, what went wrong with me, why can‚Äôt I do the things he/she can, etc. A constant feeling of being a failure.
2. The feeling of not having achieved anything, and feeling that I can‚Äôt achieve big things.
3. The extreme competitiveness/jealousy for other people when they achieve something better than me.
4. Never feel proud of the things I achieved or built, because everyone is already better than me/my work is minuscule in front of the things people have done.
5. Getting very discouraged seeing people my age/younger than me doing great things that I didn‚Äôt do at that age, to the point that if I hear/read even a single thing about it, my whole day is ruined overthinking about where did I go wrong and how much of a failure I am.
6. I literally know that if I do what I love every day, I get outsized results AND I will be very very happy, but still, I always try to do the things that are popular/that will give me external validation.
7. I am terrified of people saying something bad about me. I am afraid because a single comment makes me feel so bad that I won‚Äôt recover for weeks.
8. A constant crippling FOMO.
9. The feeling of constant restlessness of time, like how am I gonna do so many things (and be good at them) in such a little time etc.

I want to achieve great things and make a significant impact on some people in this world, and there are things that I love doing(and they pay decent so the money will never be the problem here) that I know will do that for me and lead me to the life I want according to my morals.

But these are the things that are holding me back, I am not doing the things I love because there are more popular/easy/more money-making jobs in the world but then I am not good at those things because they are not what I love, but then again I feel many people will get ahead of me just because they chose this career so I start it again, but then I still don‚Äôt like it and the cycle repeats itself every 4 months or so.

This has become insufferable now, I have banged my head trying to find a solution, broken down miserably many times, and wasted the last three years of my life being confused, but never told anyone about this, until today, I don‚Äôt know what to do.

You may feel like this is petty and laughable compared to some serious mental health problems (that‚Äôs the reason why I never told anyone about this) but it is the only thing between me and peace of mind. And I am just sick of it to the core. Any advice will be greatly appreciated. So will be the critiques.

2024-04-04 11:46:50,reddit_post,"I grieve people or pets who are alive and well. I don‚Äôt know why? Is this normal?  F28 and now an 27 weeks pregnant, which has made this ‚Äúgrieving‚Äù worst especially towards my partner. Also have ADHD and I wonder if RSD plays a factor in this. 

I haven‚Äôt spoken about it to anyone because it makes me feel crazy but also like no one wants to be told I was thinking about their death (not caused by me, just to clarify). 

Growing up, my parents were both in military and it started then. Especially post 9/11 and Afghanistan/Iraq war era. I essentially, think about their death, how it would affect me (emotionally, physically and even the impact on my life it would have). It‚Äôs been from my grandparents, parents, siblings, pets, friends, partners and now adding on my baby. 

I noticed that these thoughts are often triggered after either feeling guilty for making someone upset or responsible for their emotions, unable to help the way the individual needs, and feeling like I hope this isn‚Äôt the last interaction we have because I wouldn‚Äôt want to remember the last time with them being upset. 

This has been particularly more reoccurring since being pregnant. It‚Äôs like I have FOMO for my partner or my child. But, also love them sooo deeply that I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do. Sometimes it‚Äôs not even death, it could be him moving on and my child choosing their dad and his ‚Äúnew (fake) family‚Äù but, me not wanting to be in the way of their happiness so I let them go. 

Which in turns emotionally kills and even though this isn‚Äôt a real situation it‚Äôs hurts soo deeply and causes me to sob. 

It‚Äôs almost as if I‚Äôm subconsciously grieving their lost ahead of time (whether due to death or them leaving) so I can be prepared if it were to happen. Even thought it would still be 1000x way worst than what I imagine. Almost as if my brain is trying to protect me from a sudden lost. 

I think I have so many hopes and dreams and things are finally coming together: like a career, family, true ove and my brain is like don‚Äôt take it for granted as this can go away any moment. 

So yeah‚Ä¶ at least‚Ä¶ I love people like it‚Äôs the last time I might have with them. But, it‚Äôs emotionally painful too.

I realize it could be embarrassing to let someone know you were thinking about their death, but do you have a good friend or your SO who you think you could talk with, and let them know it isn't personal with them, but happens with others you care about?

Also, do you have access to a counselor?

It could be more intense because of your pregnancy, and anticipation of your child who you instinctively want to keep safe.

2024-04-04 17:12:18,reddit_comment,"I so get this OP. No, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs abnormal or weird or bad to think this way; it‚Äôs quite indicative of the love or connection you feel to the people you are grieving + high awareness of how life could potentially be without them. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúanticipatory grief‚Äù and something the brain comes up with under the idea that by grieving in advance, you‚Äôd be more capable to face things when the *actual* event happens, sort of like what it does with worry and anxiety. 

I‚Äôm an only child and I‚Äôve had this fear for years where I‚Äôm essentially mourning even though in the present is fine. When my relationship with my parents wasn‚Äôt the best, I still had this fear because they were still my parents and were the only ones who knew me as a child, and I‚Äôm the only one who knows who they are as a parent. There was a lot of anticipated anxiety about how I‚Äôll survive as an orphan because I perceived utter aloneness without them. 

Now, my relationship is great and it feels the grief has gotten worse. I spend more nights crying about this because now there‚Äôs the added fear of the pain I‚Äôll experience when someone I love is gone. Less to do with surviving. Like you, I also have ADHD & RSD so maybe that‚Äôs why it feels unbearable. I also feel I‚Äôm more afraid of the grief than the event itself, like, the fact that I *will* go through it scares me like nothing else. 

Just to say‚Äî I don‚Äôt think this is weird. Yes it‚Äôs something that can be processed in therapy & maybe the tendency to do it will reduce but it‚Äôs still something that happens and we can reframe it as an indication of love and loss.

Feel free to give it a lookup and if anyone is interested, there's opportunities to volunteer with hospice or check out local death cafes and connect with people around death and dying.

I delete all social media‚Äôs and only check instagram for 15 minutes every 2/3 days. I get intensely anxious from social media and finally acknowledged the bad impact it has had on my mental health for years. I thought only checking it for 10 minutes every few days to answer messages (and check some people‚Äôs stories, I know I shouldn‚Äôt) would reduce the anxiety I get from this app. It hasn‚Äôt.

I felt horrible that other people I knew were out living their best lives, even though I logically know that we all put our best selves out there (myself included), it still affected me.

There seems to be an idea floating around that any introverted person is just socially anxious and they still need human interaction. But I know that is not the case for me. 

I can talk with the right people for hours, I casually walk up to strangers and can normally interact with them. I got good at setting boundaries and realizing my self worth and I am aware of my insecurities and insufficiencies, maybe more than I should be but usually I am unapologetic about it. 

I am just extremely disappointed after  spending time with people, it feels like it is time flushed down the drain. Every time. 

Usually it is also followed up by resentment to each human interaction I am forced to have for the next couple of days. 

I do have a whopping sum 2 friends and a girlfriend. Every time I plan something with them it just stresses me out.

I find myself constantly looking at friends snap map locations in my home town (not in a weird way and only certain friends, the ones in particular I‚Äôve known for over 13 years) because I simply have such bad FOMO and still want to be with them and I feel like checking snap map and keeping in contact is a way I can still somewhat be there. 

I‚Äôve broken down multiple times even since leaving my home town and traveling to Anchorage. Thinking about just how much my friends and even their own families have told me how much they care for me, for some reason makes me incredibly emotional and I feel the opposite of what I should feel, I just feel sad, and cry, especially after one of my buddies moms sent me a text about how much I meant to her and their family, and that she viewed me as a second son. 

I don‚Äôt get why I‚Äôm feeling so sad about leaving, I get this way with any trip I take, but even in the past of leaving Alaska, and saying goodbye sometimes for even much longer periods of time, it has never felt this bad and saddening.

2023-09-06 10:14:07,reddit_post,"I have a girlfriend yet I feel unfulfilled in the relationship I love my girlfriend. I love her so much, she is my everything, I love her I adore her I worship her. I would and have done EVERYTHING I can for her. It‚Äôs been said in the past that I become a ‚Äúless than stellar‚Äù friend once I get into a romantic relationship. I believe there might be some truth to that statement but not much, the only reason I think that might have any truth behind it is because that I believe when you‚Äôre in a committed relationship that person literally is supposed to be your everything. Body, heart, and soul all of me is hers and I expect vice versa. So yes, have I skipped out on hanging out with friends to be with my gf? Yes. Have I prioritized my gfs needs over others? Yes. Do I regret any of it? No.

When I get into a relationship I put in 110%, it is the single most important aspect of my life bar-none. Some people may say this thought-process is toxic or self-destructive, but I‚Äôm sorry, if I‚Äôm going to attempt to spend the rest of my life with someone should I not do everything in my power for them? I have no intent of changing my mindset or thoughts on this, I‚Äôm in my third year of college now and I‚Äôve felt this way since eighth grade. I love hard, I expect that same love in return.

Hence the problem, I have no doubts my girlfriend loves me. She tells it to me quite often and expresses it quite well. I‚Äôm not abused emotionally or physically in anyway, things are okay. That‚Äôs the problem though, things are just okay. Although I know my gf loves me, I‚Äôm also painfully aware that it is not in the same way I love her. I won‚Äôt completely claim it‚Äôs necessarily ‚Äúless‚Äù than I love her (although it‚Äôs a suspicion that often creeps in the back on my mind) but it is different in a way that I don‚Äôt feel completely compatible with.

We‚Äôve been together for almost two years and in those two years almost none of the issues I‚Äôve complained to her about several times have been fixed. I feel neglected and less valuable to her than her friends, she has EXTREME FOMO and it seems like she will always choose the group over me no matter what. In the rare occasions that she does choose me, she spends a lot of the time talking about how bad she feels or scared that her friends will be upset with her. She also has a desperate need for attention, something that I understand, I also desperately desire her attention. The problem is she needs attention not just from me.

There have been four separate times where she‚Äôs spoken to guys who obviously want to fuck her, and the cycle is always the same. She starts talking to a guy, I tell her that he wants to fuck her and is hitting on her, and that it makes me feel uncomfortable and I want her to stop talking to him. She says ‚Äúit‚Äôs not like that.‚Äù Then continues talking to them for days, or weeks, or months, until they make an obvious move to flirt with her and then finally she shuts them down.

This is after I spent the entire time she talks to them begging her not too but she doesn‚Äôt because she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to hurt their feelings.‚Äù This is a constant with her. She is always putting other people‚Äôs emotions, even complete strangers, above my own. I would NEVER do that to her, but she does it to me constantly.

So yeah I think it‚Äôs pretty easy to understand why someone like me with all the things about myself I listed above, can feel slightly unfulfilled in a relationship like this. I love her, and despite the way this post in framed I know she loves me. Please no one in the replies telling me to break up with her or that she‚Äôs cheating on me, I understand this post was framed very negatively but that‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm venting out frustrations.

You might be feeling unfulfilled in your relationship because you‚Äôre lacking in other areas of your life - friendships etc. It‚Äôs really important to find balance between all the things that make you who you are and not just be focused on one part of it. 

As for her ‚Äútalking to other guys‚Äù she‚Äôs not necessarily doing anything wrong. She‚Äôs allowed to have friendships (even if it is with the opposite sex) and she does the right thing by shutting it down the second things become inappropriate. She‚Äôs looking for friendship and I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with that (if you‚Äôre insecure about it then that is your own problem) It‚Äôs not like she is hiding these people from you, is she? 

Let her spend time with her friends. You should be using that time to be with yours, too. Never put her in a position where she has to ‚Äúchoose‚Äù between you and her friends - just let her go and have fun.

2023-09-06 15:07:03,reddit_comment,"in total agreement with the other commenter here, but im going to elaborate my perspective 

you need to keep in mind that a relationship is an ongoing constantly renewed mutual agreement by two people. she chooses to be with you, and you choose to be with her. its not an obligation and it doesnt necessarily take precedence over other things in your life. this relationship is not promised or necessarily permanent. it should always be cherished. genuinely wholly. focus on what you can give, not what the other person provides for you. 

im going to go out on a limb here and assume you are on the younger side. i once felt a very similar way about my highschool girlfriend of 4 years and some in college, almost to a tee, i could have written this post myself at that time. I will tell you that holding onto my insecurity, and that inability to recognize my girlfriend at the time as a fully independent person, which is what your gf is, only set me up to fail, injured my relationships, and caused me deep emotional pain for a long time when it all predictably didnt work out.

your girlfriend is allowed to meet people who are attracted to her and she might even be attracted to them, men or women or otherwise, and part of that continued renewal of relationship is setting boundaries with people; inside and outside of our relationships. you are obviously attracted to your girlfriend, other people are allowed to be too. there is no harm in attraction. you can be attracted to your friends, people often are, but that doesnt delegitimize your friendship or ability to maintain a monogamous relationship with another person. you likely have friends who attracted to you as well though you might not see it, or they havent made moves on you. your girlfriend is clearly by your own words respecting your relationship by shutting these men down. shes not under obligation to avoid meeting men or have you vet or approve her opposite sex relationships. You do not possess her, she cannot be possessed relationships do not make people into possessions that can bent to expectations, and that mindset will only poison your relationships. you cannot expect another person to make you everything in their lives. All expectations should be discussed in a relationship, but that one is not a reasonable one.

I say all of this because I truly resonate with this post and that it reminds me a lot of the younger me. When you say your girlfriend loves you and expresses it to you, but you don't think that she loves you in the same way; you could be, in fact as i was, describing an unhealthy obsession with your girlfriend. A single person should not be your entire existence. This is true in a healthy relationship you need balance. You need friends and other people in your life. A single person cannot be everything and the weight of being someone's everything is too much for anyone to bear. you need to learn to trust your girlfriend unless she has given you a real reason to distrust her but it sounds like shes honest with you, and to let her be her own person, because what a relationship is supposed to be; people living their own lives who choose to be together. you cannot bend her to your idea of what she should be. this will only push her away from you and you'll have no one to blame but yourself. I promise that I speak from experience in this matter. 

and when you do push her away, you will struggle with deep emotional pain as you reel from this obsession that you've built around this person, this idea of this person being stripped away from you.  And your pain and anguish and frustation will grow as you realize that she is more than just the idea that you have built up in your head and she is capable of more and anything. it took me many years of being depressed and other broken relationships, in which I tried to do it again, and suffered more pain,  to figure out all of this, and if I could go back and change it, I would. this is why I'm telling you now. ive got a lot more to tell but honestly this is a condensed version. 

you admit to neglecting your other relationships in your life in favor of your girlfriend, you need to focus on your own identity, separate from the couple identity, in order to build a secure sense of self and self-esteem that is required to maintain a healthy functioning relationship with another fully independent multifaceted human being. yes the perspective of getting obsessively fixated is in fact toxic and self-destructive. I hate to break it to you dude but being in your third year of college does not mean that your mind cannot be changed and you need to let go of the mindset that you are this unchanging or immovable being. life will bring you challenges, and they will require you to be adaptable, malleable, and able to grow and overcome.

The best advice, though im not sure it was solicited, I can give you is to apologize to your girlfriend for how you've been acting, ask her what she needs from you in an honest and genuine way to feel happy and fulfilled; try to provide that earnestly, and to focus on your other friendships, health and your personal interests. 
that uncomfortable feeling you describe being unable to fight, you have to sit with it. learn to let it pass over you and through you and be comfortable in uncomfortable feelings passing. you cannot hold jealousy and have meaningful fulfilling authentic relationships free of tension and judgment. 

Let her be her own person, grow with her instead of trying to contain her. share in her achievements, give her praise, build her up, encourage her friendships, and her dreams. Allow her to take risks and be there to support her no matter what the outcome. be her bestfriend first and all love will come.  recognize her soul separate from yours. recognize her own story and how you fit into her life. let go of your fear of losing her. This is how true love grows. Together. The central theme of relationships and of life is change. you need to be comfortable, or at least be able to manage in a healthy way, with the idea that people grow and change. You will grow and change. your girlfriend will grow and change your life will change. fighting these changes will cause suffering. you need to find peace and security in yourself to navigate these changes. your mental health and your relationship will improve vastly. 

TLDR: let go of your fear. you need to cherish her, not control her. 

good luck, peace in your heart and all that.",snakegriffenn,14

He (26m) is funny and very very sweet. But it's the same silly repetitive jokes now that both of us make to eachother. There's lack of effort.

Today we were looking at our Instagram archives, and I noticed that he was so funny and interesting up till a year ago. He was more active on his socials, went out more, had intelligent jokes, etc. 

When he talks about his ex from college (they dated for 3 years) he says that it was the purest most fun period of his life falling in love with her. He also clarifies that by the end he didn't like her but still. I feel so much FOMO and jealousy that he doesn't feel as much for me. Of course he was a teenager then, and it was his first long term relationship, but still. He had so many stories and posts with her. His jokes were really funny and he had a stronger personality. He was someone I would have a crush on.

He doesn't do any of those things with me though. He jokingly says that all his online activity was to woo women but i don't know. He used to meet people often, had a happening life, read more, enjoy his job. Now he doesn't like his job, just meets me in the name of socialisation, plays video games for relaxation. He is taking therapy for work dissatisfaction and I am not complaining about him being a bad boyfriend to me. After all I didn't need to woo him either. I just want to feel more impressed with him.

I am 20 and still have never had a boyfriend and barely get any romantic attention from the opposite sex. People around me and my friends would often tell me that i look good or that i am pretty (even tho i would want to, most of the time i do not feel like this), my nickname is disney princess. I like spending time around people, have a nice job, am doing very well in uni, and still i do not understand what i am doing wrong to not even have a guy approach me. 

I often get comments from male acquaintances telling me they had the biggest crush on me but not to worry because they don't like me anymore. I don't understand why i would be intimidating or hard to approach, i am quite a nice person to others (ü§¢feels awkward to write this about me). These comments are sometimes hurtful as i might actually like them in that moment. I guess this could be fomo, but all my friends are either dating or they meet different guys and have flimgs with them, i just feel like an outsider who doesn't fit in.

Now i am wondering if there is something about mw not liking the attention i would get and trying to be more lowkey?? My friends often ignore me, especially some female friends, and maybe because i get top grades as a law student, they often like to jokingly make comments on how it is useless to work hard on grades and i need to chill, that i am super crazy. I find this infuriating as i could just for example start texting about random unrelated to school stuff and they would start replying ""Omg u so crazy u need to chill, u need a vacay, u r going to burnout"", it's so confuaing, i dont even study that much, i go out very often, i get to do a parttime job i love as well.

If you can't see a therapist, self-help is better than nothing. A lot of people benefit from it. Self-help is a way to show you're serious that doesn't create friction in the family. In fact, it wouldn't be surprising if your parents liked some healthy changes in your behavior.  
  
Self-help can be educational for parents as well as kids. A good self-help book explains what therapy for depression is like.  
  
With depression, there's what seems like a Catch 22. People say, ""I know there are things that will make me feel better - getting exercise, taking care of myself, straightening up the house and cleaning, but I'm depressed and I don't have the energy.‚Äù  
  
Here's the thing - very important. People do have energy when they're depressed - as much energy as they always do, but for some reason, the system is reluctant to let you use your energy.  
  
We have to use psychology to coax energy out of our systems. Psychology has some nifty tricks.  
  
A famous psychiatrist, Abraham Low, said that when we can't control our feelings we can still control our muscles. If you tell your arms and legs to get you our of bed or to the bathroom for a shower, they will obey.  
  
Try this when it seems that you're too tired to work. Lie on the couch, close your eyes, and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for 5 minutes.  
  
This is a motivation trick that's been used in behavior modification programs since the 1930s. If a task seems like it's too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time, and start with something really, really easy. Cleaning - start by cleaning for 3 or 4 min and take a 5 min break. Homework - start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter you're going to read by looking at headings, sub-headings, etc.  
  
You don't have to be an athlete to benefit from exercise. As little as 20 min brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you don't make yourself sick of exercise with too much and quit. Steve Ilardi, the therapist/researcher who headed the lifestyle-depression project at the Univ of Kansas, talks about enjoyable ways to get exercise.  
  
If you go to Metapsychology, you can read a psychologist's review of Dr Ilardi's book (""splendid"").  
  
Of all the traditional mind-body practices (meditation, etc.), the one with the best evidence for affecting mood disorders is slow breathing. It‚Äôs used for treating anxiety, depression, panic disorder, and PTSD. It's safe and it doesn't take any training.  
  
Video, below - details about self-help based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression - nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise, and social support, also traditional Asian methods.  
  
It has advice specifically for depressed students, such as StudentsAgainstDepression.org.

Always remember that there are people you can talk to, like a school counselor.

2022-12-20 19:27:18,reddit_comment,"You are suffering the walls you have built around your self. We create this walls to protect us and little by little we start noticing that while this walls protects us they also imprison us. The thing is that they have been protecting you from anxiety for so long that now you don't have the courage to leave them behind because that would mean a transformation of who you are and you are afraid of change.

The walls in your case are a metaphor of your routine, that cycle of super narrow activities where you feel in control and at the same time are so narrow and monotonous and predictable that is draining any kind of emotion and excitement from your life. These two opposite sides of your routine are why you are addicted to it, in one side you feel like you are in control of your life on the other side you know that's not life, life is happening outside of those walls.

Why are you afraid of change? because change means unpredictability and unpredictability means lack of control and exposure. Yo have subconsciously learned during your life that control helps you to avoid fear and thats why control is codependent of fear. So first you feel fear of a situation that could happen in the future then this fear creates the urge to control the situation and what will happen in the future and instead of learning techniques that help you deal with fear you narrow most possibilities and opportunities in your life until you find yourself watching the same videos over and over and playing video games you don't want to play.

Where does your insecurities come from? how does your mind work? what does your inner dialogue tell you under stressful situations? what do you consider an stressful situation?

Become vulnerable, drop the heavy armor you have been wearing all your life, let life hit you like a truck and you might learn there was nothing to fear.",fernandollb,6

2022-12-20 21:01:22,reddit_comment,"Don't let this crippling feeling take over your life. Your 19 and you have time. I'm 37 and I've been experiencing the exact same thing for 5/6 years, as result of ignoring what I'm now being told by a therapist has been years of ignored depression and anxiety.

I burned myself out with work, with the theory being that I used work to distract myself. Along the way, I kinda lost my identity. Friends, hobbies and interests stopped being, well, interesting. The point about re-watching the same old things over and over - that's been me, the same with music, too.

I know it's the obvious answer, but you do need to seek help. You need to figure out why you've reached this point, and that's what a therapist helps you do - think things more clearly.

One thing I have learned, though, is that you also need to be a little more proactive. I know it's tough and I know that crippling feeling, but I also believe that *nothing changes if nothing changes*. 

That's not to say that digging into a new TV series or getting engrossed in a new video game will suddenly fix things - of course it won't. But it does help break these habits. Take baby steps.

Again, you're only 19. Don't let this shape your life. Wishing you the best x",cardinalplum,4

2022-12-20 21:57:47,reddit_comment,"If you look back 5 years, what was your 14 y/o self doing?  What dreams did they have? What inspired them? 

Have your dreams been dashed?  Has a career path been taken from you? 

 Is this why you're idling?  Are you in school? Working?  

If you're just getting by, you need to pick yourself up and find some new choices -- even if they don't last.

And like the other poster said getting up and doing something is something you can do with a thought.  The body moves when commanded.  

Another motivational trick is 5-4-3-2-1.  Like a rocket countdown, count down those numbers and decide to get up and take a walk, do a chore, or get out of bed and you may find it will help.

Don't waste time ruminating over what isn't working in your life; find out what does work, even if you look at thing after thing.  

Make a dream board of the things you want, find out what you need to get them (ie how much to earn) and find ways to get there (career path, vocation) and keep narrowing down what works best for you and is a good fit.

At 14, I had dreams of signing being a pilot or a scientist.  I built flying models and was interested in the military for my flight training.  At 18 I failed my military entrance exam and I had no money for college.

I spent most of my 20s in minimum wage jobs, and finally got into a trade school at 27.

I tried to get my degree, but family and work obligations kept me from it -- which limited my earning and I winding up as working poor.  

Don't let yourself go down the same path by sitting back and doing nothing.

Ill give my two cents in of how I dealt with it and hope you it gives you some insight.

Other than that, I wont say ""go for a walk"" or stuff like that, but what you can do for yourself is keep clean, workout, and eat right. Then assuming you arent stuff in the middle of a shit town start finding ways to meet folks, there are often meetups for various interests. But I think first you need to look out for yourself and stabilize the best you can, if you can ask for your parent's help to get therapy and do those things above will help stabilize you to where you can actually have the energy to socialize.lize.ize.

Most people that keep thinking about it is not because they are more conscious or smarter but because they are so incapable of handling life that they have to think about life closure and create philosophies around it like ""why should I do anything if I am going to die?"". While some people are questioning death while being depressed others are enjoying life and learning from it and the many things it has to offer while it last. Your comment could be applied to literally anything since every single thing will cease to be, why eating if I am going to die? why enjoying this video game if it is going to end? why finishing this TV show if is going to end? etc etc.. the real question is why question everything instead of enjoying life if it is going to end?

I've been at this state for almost a year now (since April last year) and I have been searching for a job/career, plans I can commit to for weight loss, and a possible relationship.

I start off with I've made at least 300 applications and had almost 50 interviews that met with me not being the right person as either I don't dress professionally (I do not have a business professional/casual outfit) nor can I afford one, I have a gym subscription which I struggle to get to as sometimes I feel like I can't even get out of bed, which in turn caused me gain more weit, and for the last one is I know I shouldn't seek relationships with being at the bottom of a barrel right now but things just aren't the same from my last relationship (my first one).

I feel like there is something I'm missing or don't understand, I ask rather inappropriate questions and can output an emotion I don't mean to portray, when communicating with others and they tell me about incredibly fun things they do or what they have plans for, I get this insane amount of jealousy or FOMO and just become depressed laying in bed and not eating to hatching out plans to just walk away from home.

2023-11-23 15:34:48,reddit_post,"Nagging feeling that I might be falling short Hey everyone, I hope this is a good place to seek some advice. Unfortunately, I can't discuss this with my therapist at the moment since she's unwell (wishing her a speedy recovery). It's not a pressing issue, more of a persistent feeling I'd like some input on.

I'm a 30-year-old single guy, and on the surface, things seem pretty good. I have a fulfilling job that involves a lot of travel and live events. I recently bought my own apartment, turning it into a haven post-work. I've got a supportive circle of family and friends. Earlier this year, I stopped taking Zoloft after a decade as I'm no longer clinically depressed, and I've developed coping mechanisms to manage my anxiety. I've been sober for two years now. Yet, there's this nagging feeling that I might be falling short or missing out on something.

I wonder if part of it relates to being newly single since March, but I haven't and never really faced major issues in that department. However, parties lost their appeal after getting sober, and I mostly attend events for work as a videographer or on site editor. Could this lack of 'going out' be triggering some fear of missing out (FOMO), even if it's for something I don't find appealing anymore?

Any thoughts or perspectives on what might be causing this persistent feeling would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your input, Reddit fam!",Ofthe876,3

2024-01-09 09:11:54,reddit_post,"Shadows of the crash P.s alot to read...alot!....Up until now, I don't know, if I was doing it for myself or for others but it took me a long time to realize that it was to be distracted away from the big event in my life, the fears the inevitable big mental breakdown, that I was going to have or be involved in. Social media from 2007 to about 2020 and the pressures of Life while having to be told you need to be or put into a system without brakes or a big enough break, did not help in this regard. But I did my best to drag myself, to not have it be worn, on my sleeve but it wasn't easy. Until high school it got betterish ,the distracting, early early mornings to travel to school and get home late got me jaded. for a while, till I graduated but then life, just kept getting more pressure and the stress creeped up. Just kept building up or worse events that weren't accounted for. They made the current me too stressed out and overwhelmed to being burnt out, I did my best and I dragged my feet but it just kept getting worse and worse from 2015 to 2019. 
  Then 2020 of April covid...I was in great shape still, not mentally tho bleh, I got really sick, no clue what it was, thought it was a bad fever of some sort. I was bed ridden, in pain for a week, it was by far the worst pain at that time I have felt. The third time was worse with infections... The fever was high 100s, my head was forgetting who I was because it hurt so bad but that guy was seriously sick of it all, at this point, I was angry, tired and irritated. so I laid down literally, let go of my body, I just said, I want to work on me but I let my old self go. Thought it would work but stress eated like crazy, all of my thoughts, my past selfs, just started to unravel, I just got more and more depressed, being in my thoughts being alone but maybe that's just what you need to do. Of course I did more stuff but a simplified version, the jist of vagueness, I kept doing that for 4 years distracting myself too, watching TV shows, video games, anime, YouTube, sports, dealing with holidays ,family, friends all that. 
   but the one thing that kept bugging me was the main reason for all of these lingering problems or frustrating pent up neglect, it's really a crock pot, but it's the big ingredient, it finally reached up to me until now. It was preventable it could have been dealt with more, sincerity but it was already too late . I'm just incredibly sad now. Because of what we did as a family, we could have done better and cared more about it. But we just got complacent, we got distracted, seriously distracted because that was our medicine..sadly.. it put us in a whirlpool of the past and now we're just going crazy. I think I want to stop being that person in a Limbo with this crash and distraction with life, I just wanna be free. It's just to piled up. This is more so for the idea of it and to understand the it but I just don't wanna be looked at whenever I tell someone they give me that look that hurt look. All I wanna say is, I don't know how I'm going to get there but I'm going to try a lot because... it will do that justice and myself, finally I think I'm accepting it better just sucks it had to be the worst outcome for it to happen. But With a bit of distracting and a bit of gung ho with breaks, I'll hope to get there before 30 I hope hahah.
  I'm going to try to find myself and who I should strive to be, be a happy person again, even tho it's been 25yrs since then haha.... Not run or blind myself but accept it. I don't want to say what it is because it's pretty shitty and really the point of my pain. But really all I wanna say is ""You don't have to distract yourself from the issues of your childhood or adulthood. Even if it makes you regret waking up in life or putting on a mask or even just dragging your feet. You can face them, accept them, find ways to dance with them, find a solution and try to make the future better for them, being past, present and future you. Yeah the past sucked but now is now"" 
   I'm tired of feeling that way. I don't expect all of you to understand and I'm sorry! Really in the current state of things for whatever, I'm sry. I think I just need a bigger break, mostly from my life and how life works. I wish you all the best. I really don't like how the world works rn especially social media but I'll get there when I get there to navigate that part, rn me. Thanks to all the people that were on my journey from up until now, truly my school days were hectic and bizarre. but it was also the most inclusive, wholesome, chaotic fun I've had. I didn't have time to work on the real issue. Maybe it's selfish but I think we all need alone time, be okay with the quiet, navigate our wacky minds, not be anxious of fomo, to accept youself, not just them to distract you.
  Apologies for my rambling its a tough time, I just want you to know the why, in some way of why, I was the way, I was and in the past 4yrs, I just wish you all the best in your mental health, here's to 2024, being 28 or whatever age, you may be, don't get distracted, you may blink and be 28 ..... here is for the present and future. Sry to the kids, I hurt when I was a kid, you know who you are, not alot but you know mistakes and bs.

22M




Every day I feel like shit , just after opening my eyes , till closing them . Escaping from reality in every sense possible because that's what I always do . Running from the challenge.






I never took a stand for myself or anything I loved and kept losing everything , whatever good I had . All the chances I missed because I did nothing , just sit back and let all things happen, try to run away from the reality .





Didn't take any risk, never worked hard as I always thought I was gifted but fuck this mindset honestly . I'd rather be hard working and be satisfy with my efforts than being gifted and taking everything as granted.





Anxiety, depression and fomo took everything over and lead everything in such a negative way that I don't have any energy to correct anything. 





I never had any goals and even if I had any , I didn't work any hard for them . Loved a girl but was coward , couldn't express my love watching every single guy proposing her and taking a shot to date her , I underestimated myself and got insecure , acted like a bitch everytime and lost my chance and when a guy harrassed her mentally, I couldn't do shit . I hate myself to this day and it's been 7 years since all this happened . After that I got so insecure about myself that I stopped talking to any girl and completely because socially isolated , avoiding people . What if I love a girl and I couldn't save her AGAIN , I don't deserve anyone .







I cut off all my friends because of fomo as my anxiety was wayy too much to handle from the fact that they all did what I couldn't. I cut everyone off silently and never contacted them ever again . 







Social anxiety and everything happening around me triggers me to my past and this whole city and people reminds me that how coward I am . How shit I am .
I just want to leave this city and never wanna comeback.






Got addicted to smoking so badly after promising myself for so many years that I will never smoke no matter what. Addicted to all those shitty instant gratification dopamine bullshits . 





I try every single time to socialize but it doesn't work . Something triggers me so badly and I come back again to zero .





When I see the guys who ever proposed the girl I loved , I want to k!|| them all . Every single one of them . 





I can't describe in words how shit I feel everyday and it's looking like never ending process , headaches are so common that normal times I feel abnormal and headches are normal .




I wish I could finish all this but Naah . 

When I see any guy being with his gf , it reminds me how I never too any chance .  Guy with good career reminds me How I never too any chance . Guys with better life than me reminds me how zi didn't do anything to make mine better . 





Living in past all the time since so many years , daydreaming to cope from reality and make everything perfect in the past .

I am in my opinion good looking guy, or at least average, kinda picky when it comes about relationships, and because of that I haven't dated many guys, but dated fair enough number in order to have this conclusion that I am having right now, that is, I feel like I can (and I do) catch feelings VERY EASILY to the point where after stopping the dating or relationship, because of any reason, but it has been mostly distance, it can hurt so much and it always distracts me during the day, BUT after a few days and distraction, I can lose them to the point where they don't hurt anymore, also VERY EASILY, I don't know if I am catching or losing the feelings more easily at this point. But this is a problem, because the period between having them and losing them, when the relationship is not possible anymore, is INTENSE and very difficult (going through such a period right now). So for example I have been on a few Tinder dates in the past, and when there was attention from the other side, (because usually either I am not interested or the other side, lol), and when there's chance to have something together, I get attached and that's it. After that if for whatever reason that connection is not possible anymore, I stay in love with the perfect memory (I read this somewhere and it makes sense, maybe it's the memory and not always or only the person), and it is chasing me. But, randomly I can lose this feeling (and that usually happens up to 1-2 weeks max) and be totally cold about that experience, like really neutral. I was also in a 1.5 years relationship with a guy. We loved each other so much, I was in love, trust me I was, and that relationship also started with great strong and fast attachment. When we ended it, it was devastating, terrible, but after 1-2 weeks, like a magic I felt OK about the break up and the memories weren't making me sad anymore but just happy that they happened. Maybe because we were toxic, but still. Once after exchange semester and saying bye to a guy with whom I had something, I felt very bad and thought I haven't done enough with him, but that feeling lasted for whole one night only... Weird, sorry if it is. But I think it might be a problem and a symptom of another underlying mental health problem. I am writing this because now I am doing an internship abroad, very far from home, where I met this guy from another country who was here on vacation. We spent 3-4 days together, the lsst days of his vacation actually, and I met him on a special day for me so that made my experience even more unique. Now he is gone, I am overthinking what we could have done differently to enjoy more the time spent together cuz we didn't get really much intimate, although we could (the reasons, well I wrote a whole different post for that). I knew that I will overthink and that this would happen in the end, because despite overthinking I am also having the fear of missing out, in general  for everything in life. So yeah, now I am here feeling very sad that he is gone, I have a weird feeling inside my stomach, first the butterflies and now this. He left yesterday, I was ""already getting better"" today until I saw his pic. I know it will be eventually gone very soon but I am starting to think more about my mental situation and what is causing these emotional rollercoasters if we can call this like that. Because it's not easy.

For those who found this interesting post and managed to read until here, THANKS SO MUCH, and I'll give you a little bit of background in case you need in order to create and opinion. Well I can write A LOT, but here is what I thought it's necessary, then I can add edits. 
So, my background (and idk if it should be related but): I have a Magical Thinking OCD, it's terrible, sometimes I have fear that if I donMt do some things correclty bad things are going yo happen. I might have a bipolar disorder, sometimes I have very quick emotional shifts, tho I don't think this is that serious in my case. I mentioned the FOMO, and then I am an extreme overthinker, I have anxieties over things and sometimes I am paranoic without a reason.",noideafornamenow,1

2023-09-28 10:01:32,reddit_post,"I feel like I'm falling behind. To give context, I currently attend community college and am a freshman aiming to transfer out by the Fall 2024 semester (basically transferring in as a sophomore). I'm an extremely ambitious and a driven individual. I work out every day at 5 in the morning, I'm in the process of joining an MMA gym, and do all sorts of things to keep myself busy because I feel like if I'm doing nothing, then I'm wasting time and I'm falling behind. 

Whenever I look around at my friends (who've gotten into top unis like UPenn, Swarthmore, UCLA, UCSD, USC, etc. all super well deserved and they've most definitely earned their spots there), I feel an extreme amount of self-pity, guilt, and a lot of FOMO. I kept trying to tell myself that I wanted to go to CC so I can become better, and I kept putting off this sense of ""what if things don't ever work out"" and how I really feel like I'm behind all my peers. Obviously the bombardment of instagram stories aren't really helping with the way I view things. 

I love meeting new people and making new friends, and I really wanted to get out of the bubble that is Orange County (mainly the Fullerton, Cerritos, La Mirada, Buena Park area) and really find some new people, and seeing my friends meet all these great people in uni is giving me a shit ton of FOMO. Staying in thsis area is making me feel depressed and feelings of inadequacy since I'm still in the same spot I was before everyone left for college. It's to the point where I can't even bear the fact that I could transfer into a Uni near my area and I become absolutely disgusted with the idea of it since it doesn't signify progress for me personally. It seems like I'm standing still while everyone is moving forward with their own lives. Obviously I'm aware of the phrase ""The grass isn't always greener on the other side"" but I just can't help feeling this way. 

I'm not really asking for hand outs from anyone and the last thing I want is pity because I already have way too much of it for myself. I also understand that attending CC was ENTIRELY my choice, and I own up to that choice, but that doesn't mean that I also expected to feel these sorts of things as lots of people tend to overlook the negatives. If you've been in a similar situation, what did you do to get over it? Obviously these feelings won't stop me from continuing forward, but it's really hard to do well when I'm feeling this shitty.",Main_Warthog1125,1

There's a piece of advice people have often said is helpful. When people say, ""I can't stop thinking about this person,"" I always say that it's impossible to stop thinking about the person but you can get control of the thinking. Reserve a time of day just for thinking about the person, like after dinner while you have coffee, decaf if you have insomnia. Think about the person any way you like, but when time is up you have to go to something else  
  
  
The treatments for anxiety and depression are not exactly the same, but they have some things in common. For example, relaxation helps with both problems. Reducing stress is good for anxiety and depression. Calming down helps you to think carefully about the thoughts that bother you. Slow breathing is especially good for this.  
   
Activity, especially physical activity, is good for depression.

2023-06-14 00:48:27,reddit_post,"All of my mental health symptoms are exhausting I am in my 30s and am just starting to live life coming off of a traumatic young adulthood (my mother ""forced"" me to live at home through threats and coercion from college graduation until I was 29) and am still dealing with emotional enmeshment and approval seeking of my parents. I am also married to someone that struggles with empathy and anger (not emotional or physically abusive, and getting much better in couples therapy). 

Dealing with emotional abuse during my entire young adulthood has made me into a nervous wreck. I don't really feel like I fit into any diagnosable category of mental illness but perhaps some sort of trauma-based anxiety. I have gone to a therapist on and off for like 5 years and I am gaining further insights into myself but no changes have really been made and I seem to be getting worse. My issues/symptoms are as follows:

* Fear of change
* Indecision anxiety
* Fear of conflict and confrontation
* Intense fear that people don't like me or scared that people are mad at me
* Obsession with schedules and to-do lists
* Type A around doing things in a certain way or certain order
* ""Adult child"" syndrome (feeling like a kid and wishing I was a kid again)
* Taking comfort in childhood likes/interests/hobbies
* Intense FOMO or FOBLB (Fear of being left behind)
* Overreaction and oversensitivity to making mistakes or something happening that I don't like 
* Cry easily (and expect to be comforted and taken care of when I do)
* Crave dependency/being taken care of
* Constant external validation and approval-seeking for my own thoughts, feelings, and opinions 
* Oscillation between loneliness and wanting to be alone
* Anxiety-based procrastination
* Constantly apologizing or asking ""are you mad at me?"" to my family and husband
* Feeling guilty for expressing my own needs",Djeter998,1

2023-06-17 05:50:56,reddit_post,"Struggling because a decision I have to make I have a first-world problem that I keep overthinking until I go mad. Can you give me your opinion please?

It's about the following: a friend of mine asked me in December if I wanted to go to India with her. I wasn't sure and since it's a lot of money, so I had to think it through. But I heavily struggle with decision making and had anxieties about it because of some past experiences (regrets of going on trips). So I got really stuck. Up until the moment I didn't have a choice anymore as the trip, which was a group travel, was fully booked. Now I very much regret that I will miss that bonding moment with her. It would be the first travel far away for both of us, and I'm missing it because I struggle with making decisions and waited too long. 

  
I'm currently doing an internship abroad and will do that too when my friend is making the trip to India. Two of my friends are actually going. Now, there is a concert of Harry Styles where I live and my friend is going there. She is a big fan! I can appreciate his music, but I wouldn't say I'm a fan. But I would really enjoy to go see him live, I think it would be a nice experience. 

  
But I'm currently doing this internship abroad which is also a nice experience. And flying back for the weekend would be quite expensive, namely 300 euro. But it's not too crazy so that I can still do it and think about it. 

  
I would have one less weekend here for my internship abroad and I will only be here for 1.5 to 2 months, I can always go back home and see my friends there. But if I go to the concert (another friend is selling tickets so that's not an issue), I could see my friends and have a bonding moment there! It's not the same as India, but it's also nice.

   
It might turn out that it's not a bonding moment after all, as my friend is going with her own friends and she will probably be very focused on Harry Styles. But it might be a bonding moment after all. I really care for that bonding moment. 

  
When I told her about my thoughts about flying back for the concert, she said it was nice of me to want to do that but that it's a lot for one weekend if I'm abroad now and I will defenitely see her again when she is back from India. 

  
But I don't want to live with regret. But I also need to learn how to be satisfied with where I am. I need to let go of the FOMO, but also want to care for my friends and want to share bonding moments with them. 

  
So now I am stuck and I don't know what to do. I need to decide by tomorrow morning though, and it's almost midnight. 

  
My mum and my two friends said that it's a bit crazy, my pschologists told me that it would be fine to do it and that I deserve it even though it's a lot of money. 

  
I don't know how to decide anymore. If I ask myself the question why I want to do it, I'd say because I care for my friends and think it would help my friendship with them. But it would also cost me a lot of money and experiences I could have here at my internship abroad.

2023-05-14 06:13:49,reddit_post,"Need some insight and advice I'm not sure what's wrong with me, and I'd like some other perspectives. 

I have a hard time focusing on any hobby, and my interests are constantly changing. For example: for a couple months I was really into Star Wars. I was reading the novels, watching the shows, getting immersed in the world and characters. I was happy with my interest in the hobby. I went to a bookstore and saw some manga on display. It's been a while since I read manga, but almost instantly I felt like I wanted that to be my hobby. My interest in Star Wars basically evaporated on the spot. 

How did I get so interested in Star Wars in the first place? Well, before that I'd been really into DC Comics. I was reading them for a couple months, and then the new season of The Mandalorian came out. After watching a few episodes, my interest in DC Comics disappeared. I was immediately obsessed with Star Wars. 

I don't understand this. I want to have a hobby or two that I'm really interested in, without my interests constantly changing like this. 

I think part of it is that for most of my life, I worked so much that I really only had time for a single hobby. I worked all day, came home, and had maybe an hour or two to really do anything I wanted to. That isn't the case anymore, but I still feel like I have such limited time. I don't know how to get my brain off this mindset.

I also feel like I have this ridiculous amount of FOMO about almost everything. I'll see a novel that looks interesting and instead of reading it and carrying on with whatever hobby I'm currently immersed in, I'll become obsessed with reading for a while because I'm worried about missing out on potentially good stories. 

Sometimes I'll get so overwhelmed that I'll just do nothing. I'll sit for a while and try to figure out whether I should read a book, or watch anime, or play a video game... and I'll end up just doing nothing. I'll just end up frustrated and angry even.

I am pretty bad at writing, so please understand. I will be dividing my issues into some segments so it will be long, but to anyone who reads it all I deeply appreciate you. 

So to start things off, I am M(23) and I am an only child in an Asian family household with traditional views. I have a perfect and wonderful girlfriend (24) who is also my first relationship and one of the few that I love a lot. I am a recent college graduate who is unemployed. I landed an internship in the summer that I just took because it was better than nothing. Currently, I am unemployed until then, but being home alone doing nothing has driven me to bad spirals that affect my motivation in life and in general. To describe my problems, I am quite an anxious overthinker who cannot seem to deal with negative emotions quite well. 

Family

As a child, I always dealt with some sort of insecurity (body image, money, fashion, etc.) and whenever I brought it up to my parents they were really not much help and I was not really given heart felt advice. Due to that, I learned to bottle it up, but it came with consequences. I had anger issues that started in elementary school, but I slowly suppressed it in high school and now I never get mad or anything, but sad and anxious. Now, I do not tell my parents of how difficult life is for me because I do not want to make them worried. I only told my mom about my struggle as my dad is not really a great communicator and he only talks about himself. My mom just encourages me to get through the hardship and that its just a phase, but what I realize is that it's just a phase if I can get through it. I am not really close with my relative and due to time zone differences I cannot keep in contact with them easily. Therefore, I have no one to necessarily talk to within my family. Moreover, I have never really gotten anything that I wanted. I took part time jobs and stuff because although, I know my family is financially stable, I do not seek out for financial help due to my father having a frugal mindset and whatever I purchase is a waste of money. I took part time jobs when I was young to fulfill my desires, but it was never enough. I always had to resort to low cost and low quality alternatives. Due to that I have never been able to fit in with other kids when I was young. I did not have a phone until high school, nor did I play any games with friends at home. Now that carried over to the present me where although I want to ask for help from my parents I don't and I do not plan to. 

My Relationship

Like I mentioned before, I have a wonderful gf who is my first relationship in my life. I met her when I was in my last year of college and things were amazing. I was having fun with her and college life was great. However, during my early days of my relationship, I was always insecure about stuff about her like her history which I took unhealthily back then by being overdramatic about it and overthinking. I learned to accept the past is the past, but I am always worried what if she happens to become attracted to her past hooks ups. I cannot help, but compare myself to all that past guys she has been with or did something because they are well off and way better looking than me. Me? I am not financially stable, I do not have a job, and I was always insecure about my acne ridden face and semi-okay body. I know for this my remedy is to go to the gym, but currently I do not have the luxury to pay a monthly fee for anything. I am constantly applying for jobs that I want to do and trying to find ways to make money, but I had no luck. So that is where I have a negative feedback loophole in my thoughts. Moreover, I always happen to feel very moody when my girlfriend says she is going to concerts or events without me. She is somewhat last minute and seizes the opportunity while I am left out waiting for her to return. As bad as it sounds, I always make scenarios in my head like what if she gets with a guy and etc. and I will never know about it. I really fear getting cheated on and I always hated cheaters. It is within my moral code to never cheat and never date a cheater. I am a firm believer that once a cheater, always a cheater because I honestly think cheating is the worst unpunishable crime there is. However, I tell myself that I trust her and nothing will ever happen, and I start to beat myself down for thinking such thoughts. 

For the past few months I have been in the lowest part of my life, and I have shown that to my gf. She is the only who knows that I have a issue with my anxiety and panic attacks. To be honest, I relied on her to help me out, but I realized that its affecting our relationship where I feel like I become a burden to her and she told me its unpleasant for her to deal with it constantly, but she will always support me. I totally agree with her because most times we are together, I just become out of it and deep in thought. Now I regret my decision to act how I did and how I reacted to things she told me and how emotionally vulnerable I was to her. I know women seek men who are more emotionally stable and making them self. However, I feel like I have done things that are irreparable and made her more likely to fall out of love. I honestly think I should break up with her since I do not want to make her life difficult and not be stuck with some depressed dude like me, but at the same time, I wanna mature and learn from her as she also dealt with similar issues as I had. I feel like I am not masculine like she wants to be and I want to improve myself somehow, but I do not know where to start. 

One last point, I found out that I have high neuroticism which exactly describes me. I was looking for ways to find out how to improve my relationship and this was the perfect way to describe me. I was looking for ways to lower neuroticism, but all I was guided was therapy and as of right now I  cannot even pay for an hour of a session. 

I really appreciate my gf. She was the first one out of my family to actually show me love and somewhat guides me into becoming a better and motivated man, but there are internal issues about the person I am that I want to change. I want to be happy so she can also be happy. 

Regrets

I have a lot of regrets in my life generally because of outside influences I cannot control. I want to change my perspective on things, but life just always hit me with BS that I do not think anyone deserves. I got into my dream university, but COVID hit. I could not go on a high school graduation trip because of my parents who I constantly reminded them that I really want to go for 5-6 years. There are so many things such a graduation pictures and Coachella that I really wanted to go *my gf is going last minute* , but I cannot because I am going out of states with my parents ( I asked to go last month when I was doing literally nothing, but they refused and said that it had to be April). I was supposed to go to a trip with my friends post college, but I cannot due to circumstances. I could not find a job because of all these events with the economy. I will never ever get these experiences back unless I travel back in time. These are things that drive me insane. I cannot enjoy this trip because of FOMO and just being left out in the dark. I have nothing to blame except myself and these forces are all something that I cannot control.  I hate the world for what is it, but I really want to change my pessimistic mindset around and become optimistic about things. I do not want to lie to myself that everything is going to go well, but I want to believe it. 

Motivation 

Leading on from my regrets segment, I have lost my faith in my abilities. People around me compliment me and put me in high regard, but I never accepted it. For example, people say I am good looking, but I do not believe that. My friends commend me for finishing college and achieving a lot of things. However, I cannot accept that because I have a high standard of life that I want to reach. I have so many goals and an image of what, where, and how I am going to be in the next 10 years. I have high ambitions, but seeing where I am right now, I just cannot seem to put in the grind anymore and lost a-lot of motivation. Even while I am working and studying, I let my negative emotions and thoughts take control of me and I resort to playing games. I have tried a-lot of things from going outside, reading books, games, and hobbies, but nothing really has helped me out so far. I lost interest in my own hobbies because I even think it is a waste of time. Also, it is the fact that I have so much free time right now, but I am achieving nothing and nor am I enjoying the free time because obviously leisure comes with money and I wanted to go on trips, amusement parks, the gym, pick up new hobbies, and therapy, but well I do not have money. I honestly felt the need to just rid myself of this world, but what kept me from making a dangerous decision are my family, friends, relationship, and regrets. 

What I am looking for

I am just honestly looking for any advice and some ways to alleviate this ongoing pain I have. I am emotionally, mentally, and physically weak and I want to grow. I want to be mature and become a ""man"". I want to achieve things beyond what I achieved. Now entering society as an adult, I do not want to waste my early 20's rotting away in my house. I want a mentor who can help me with things and give me advice, but these days its hard to find one because of all the profit seeking gurus. It is hard for me to trust people when I cannot even trust myself. 


Thank you for reaching this far and reading through. I just wanted to reach out to people who are well versed in mental health and this was the only free resource I had.",ymleee,3

2023-05-01 16:29:14,reddit_post,"Anyone know why I get intense feelings when consuming media I missed out on? I have been struggling with these horrible feelings recently and I am not sure if its some sort of anxiety or extreme FOMO? I have severe inattentive ADHD(diagnosed) and possibly autism (I am also diagnosed with general anxiety) and because of that I was always an outcast in school (I am currently 18) I'd decided that I'd never be able to fit in, and in doing so I began to reject everything that everyone else liked. Because of this, I basically lived under a rock for years and I never consumed any of the popular media other people my age did. Around a year ago, I started getting into fandoms I was seeing online that I had never seen before. Mainly FNAF, Harry Potter (hp is a big one), Pokemon, The Owl House, Etc. I found that I really enjoyed the media from these things, and initially I had felt a bit sad that I never branched out and experienced them before. However, recently it has been really weird. Whenever I see a Harry Potter edit on tiktok, or a clip from The Owl House, or something else, I get this feeling that I can only describe as incredibly intense waves of anxiety and deep sadness. It gets so bad that sometimes I feel that a panic attack might start. I have no clue why this happens and the only thing I can think of is extreme FOMO due to the fact that I was so late in experiencing things that others my age have loved since they were born basically. Not sure at all but I think I would feel a bit better if I had even slightest idea of what I'm feeling and why.",Automatic_Macaron_61,1
2023-04-05 19:38:26,reddit_post,"How do I stop a negative spiral? This is my first post on this acount because my others have friends who look at my posts:

My life is spiraling and I am not sure how to stop it. I have been spiraling downward for about a year and now I am getting close to the lowest I've ever gotten. I am now having thoughts of suicide which I can‚Äôt stop. I am struggling but I am hiding it from everyone. Here is the context:

I am a 21 y/o graduate student.

Last year I joined a social fraternity where I had my first real introduction into social drinking and smoking weed. I was pushed by my friends, my ex gf, but mostly by my FOMO. I've made incredible friends, but that is where this really started. I hid the fact I joined from my parents because I feared they would be disappointed. They have high expectations of me due to my good grades throughout high school, which I attribute to being gifted. This caused me to have that ""first time trying in college"" syndrome.

I have always been a high stress person, something I think was caused by my verbal abuse from my mom when I was a child. I am afraid of asking for help. I am also afraid of my parents and their disappointment. I want to make them proud. I am hiding everything from them. The most they know is that I was a little sad after my last breakup‚Ä¶

Last spring semester, my life started falling apart. I got into more arguments with my ex, and I started to get more and more into alcohol. I began drinking to the point that by April I realized I was starting to realize I was abusing alcohol for the first time.

In mid april 22 my ex broke things off with me for semi-related reasons. We had only lasted 1.5 years. This only pushed me further. I started to really abuse alcohol. The worst was when I got my 21+ friends to buy me bottles to hide at the fraternity house which I used to get drunk during alumni events. I was using it to hide from the pain.

I only managed to stop over the summer because my mother noticed I was drinking a lot of the vodka she was buying for our family. I managed to stop myself and hide how bad it was. Over the summer I struggled to try to recover from my breakup. I was still regretting everything I had done. My doctor asked me if I wanted SSRI's, which I refused.

Returning back to school, I started working as an RA, with many friends and my ex as coworkers. I tried my best to work on myself both with fashion and self care. My now gf was also a coworker who pursued me. I never said no to her advances, and we started a relationship in September. I sometimes regret not saying no. Being unable to say no when people ask is one of my worst qualities. This is something I‚Äôve started to realize over the last month.

Being a grad student is hard, but I had been trying my best. I noticed that my mental health was at an even lower point that last semester. I had stopped using alcohol and had switched to weed to help avoid my mental health problems. By this time I had basically un-restricted access so I used that. I was struggling with my grades, due to the inability to mentally focus on studying. I was procrastinating everything and avoiding hard work by smoking or YouTube. I failed my goal of trying to go to the gym 1/week. I haven‚Äôt worked out since last year.

In December I got elected to a very high position in my fraternity. I became one of the most important members, which increased my work load. Along with a job that I started in October in my chosen field, I was starting to get busier.

In January I had no classes over a short college break. I did absolutely nothing but play video games, watch movies, and smoke/drink. I couldn't motivate myself to do anything. I could barely get myself over to the dining hall on the cold days, yet I could get myself over to the frat house to smoke. January was the first time I realized I might be depressed. I realized that I had no interest in anything anymore besides hiding from my problems. I didn‚Äôt have any interest in my gf, studies, or and old hobbies.

Mid January I started classes again. For a short time I was prepared. The break of no classes allowed me time to recover so I tried to give it my all towards my 20 credit hours. at the beginning I was doing well. I was making friends with the people in my classes.

Over the months I have become incredibly overworked. Between school, my jobs, my relationship, and extracurriculars I barely had enough time to breathe. I started to experience my chronic stress as usual. I started doubling down on drugs/alcohol to try to get relief.

After a negative RA experience, I now no longer feel comfortable in my own room. I fear going outside and being hated. I started free online therapy through my school but ran out of credits so I no longer seek help. Since spring break, I have been not going to the majority of my classes. I have been falling further and further behind. I am now getting close to failing. I am writing this 1 hour before my next exam, which I am sure to fail. I haven‚Äôt been able to mentally focus on studying, and my jobs/frat is keeping me too busy to make time for myself. My parents pay for my school. If I fail they will waste their money, which we don't have enough of. Both my parents are killing themselves working to help me pay, yet I feel like a failure because I may be held back.

Recently, along with skipping classes, I have started to pull routine all nighters. Sleeping through classes/activities, I have been staying up all night before exams to try to study. I am forced to stay in my room because I am afraid of being in the common areas, so I am mostly non-productive. I have always struggled with body image due to being overweight my whole life. I starved myself doing Keto in high school and lost 50 lbs, which I gained back after breaking up with my 1st ex, rebounding to my heaviest weight ever when I was with my last ex. Now, I am using not eating as a form of self-punishment.

I am writing this not to complain, but to ask advice. I realize that pulling all nighters, not working out, abusing drugs, and not eating is a form of self-punishment. I have done all of this before, but now it is getting bad. I am afraid of my C- school performance which is making me double down. I am afraid because every day the self-punishment is seemingly more justified. I had only cut myself once, when I was a child trapped with my mother, but for the first time in a little while the thought of suicide has started appearing in my head. I had these thoughts over the last summer as I tried to heal from my relationship, but I managed to stop myself. I realize what I am doing is wrong, but the thought is sounding like a better idea every day. While I don't have a plan (something I know is important when judging suicide risk, as part of my trainings), the thoughts of how I could have been eating at me. I have access to dangerous medications for my work-study and job, as well as firearms back home. I am afraid that if I keep spiraling I will do something bad. My brain is telling me I don't deserve to heal.

I don't know who to reach out to. Expressing my anxiety and depression is how my last relationship ended. I cannot put this on my new gf. I do not want to tell my parrents. They don't even know I am in a fraternity. IDK how I could convince them that I am ill. No one knows how bad it is getting. I am very good at hiding my problems. Some of my freinds/frat brothers have noticed that I am overworked (which I tell them to try to get relief from the burdens they put on me), but none of them realize how in mest up I am. I am trying my best to hold it together, but I need help.

How can I stop myself? I need to do better in school but my time commitments stop me. I only have 1-2 afternoons free a week. I have 20 credits, 1 work study, 1 10-14 hr/week job, I have a high ranking fraternity position, I RA at my school, and I have a gf. I want to quit everything, but I feel like I can‚Äôt escape. How do I go on? I feel like if I could just force myself to study and improve my grades, I can make it through. I only have 1 month left, yet I am afraid because the thoughts are starting to become a daily occurrence. People think I am a rational, caring person. I try my best to put other‚Äôs needs before myself. I am breaking down but I am still hiding it from everyone. My gf knows the most, but I have hidden how much I am hurting and my suicidal thoughts from her. IDK how to go on or where to even start. Online therapy was fantastic, but the free trial has expired. My school‚Äôs free counseling center is too busy to get new appointments. What should I do?

Edit: Spelling/Grammar

Edit 2: I am sorry for the really long post. I am about to go to my exam but I know I am going to fail. I am scared.

Edit 3: Just finished my exam and its taking everything not to break down. I wont get my score back till saturday, but I know I guessed on so many that I am sure I failed. I am not sure what to do anymore. It's taking everything I have just to stay enrolled.

Edit 4: I had to have a meeting with a professor. I couldn't stop myself from crying. I felt like such a failure that I broke down over someone asking if I was ok. At the same time I got an email from my boss. They asked if I wanted support. Why do I need support? Why can't I do this on my own? Its so embarassing to be the weak one who can't get through. If only I was harder on myself about studying and being productive, this wouldn't have happened.",Specialist-Card1173,1
2023-04-06 09:26:45,reddit_post,"im not sure where im at but i know i dont care for it. i had a depressive episode (first one of my life) at hte start of the year. really threw me but i got some meds and it has stabilized me.

im in therapy and working through childhood trauma.  idk if this has anything to do with it?   i used to be a very care free, happy all the time, energetic individual.

that has changed. songs from my highschool days or college days cause me to feel emotionally gutted.  i have a friend whom i met about 6 months ago. we got along great, hung out a lot. thats changed now, she is busy as hell at work and now she as a BF so our friendship has become less attentive.  i find places that we used to hang out cause me to again feel totally gutted.

at first i thought it might be anxiety but now i see its this emptiness, this feeling if despair.  when i message people and see they read what i sent but did not reply i feel alone, isolated, again... semi gutted.

i cry that i have no one in my life to romance.  i spent most of my life working, work was ALL that mattered. my past relationships suffered greatly because my partners ALWAYS took a back seat.  i can see how ive missed chances to possibly build a future with someone. it was just not on my radar until recently.

i do not like feeling this way. i want to feel happy and energetic again. i dont want this fomo and realization that i lived my life wrong.  part of my therapy is around emotional incest trauma from mom. i never realized just how much i conformed to her views, her words, her teachings. it totally broke me as a man, as a partner. i behaved poorly with my ex's, emotionally unavailable. and i FELT that was the right/proper/correct way to be. it was a choice. a poor one.

i fear that all the meds in teh world wont make any difference until i some how figure out a way to come to peace with this...   i also fear i may be so desperate to find love that ill ignore signs that someone might be the wrong partner for me...

im able to work on SOME passion projects but i cant seem to get myself into the totally committed mind set. instead im doing a couple hours a day and projects around the house are kinda piling up. i wish i could go back a year and a half and somehow carry that person forward to now. i wish id never started delving into childhood crap... ignorance is some times bliss.... i feel therapy as fucking failed me.

most of my friends are younger. my older friends have family, kids, lots of crap going on. my younger ones are working doubles. trying desperately to save, afford bills... they have multiple jobs... no time to hang out, hard to talk... i have lots of free time... single, own my home. i feel alone that i cant hang out with my friends.",newstableiswut,1
2023-02-07 17:16:32,reddit_post,"(21M) In the end I realized I was just trying to be in a victimhood .[ Rant ]  

#  

I feel guilt and regret for being such a dumb person . I could have just did better but instead of taking responsibility , I tried covering all these with the name of ADHD , PTSD ,OCD etc .

Above mentioned disorders are really serious and it's just doesn't happen randomly . I was just trying to find an excuse . ADHD was the perfect excuse for me to cover up my silly mistakes when the clear reason I was having adhd like symptoms was because of my too much mobile phone addiction , binge eating habit , isolation , anxiety , depression and fomo which I think are really common and can happen to anyone and It's not really that difficult to escape from these situations .

But I chose the worse way . instead of taking responsibility for my failure and mistakes , I tried to give excuses . I could have easily overcame everything but me being too free and not engaging myself in anything because of the stupid mentality I have just made everything worse .

Now I realized I can't blame anyone anymore . It's just my fault . I accept it completely . but I don't feel anything like suici#al or something . I want to face it this time but you know the feeling of guilt and regret just went over my head and It's really bothering me .

I am really sorry to my family who had a lots of expectation from me .

I am really to the girl I couldn't confess my love to and then she suffered so much because of that .

2023-01-05 19:39:37,reddit_post,"Decision about travelling/money Hi Reddit, I need your advice

Making choices stresses me out. A lot. It's mostly choices that are social in nature, like should I go there with those people or not. It's related to FOMO and the fear of missing great opportunities and happines. (For context, I'm a 22 year old and live in Western Europe).

The last six months, I had the opportunity to go on trips with friends two times, but the situation I was in made me question if I should go. The first time it was because I was supposed to be working for uni and the second time I already made plans with friends at home. Both times, I felt depressed because I had to make the choice and I ended up not going on the trip with my friends. As going on trips with friends is something I love and always wanted to do when I was younger, but couldn't because my friends were not interested in that then, I felt like I was robbing myself from something I've longed for for so long by not going. After staying home, for multiple reasons that made me make that choice, I felt absolutely terrible and couldn't leave my bed for a long time.

One other time, I went on a trip with one of my friends and 3 friends of her that I didn't know. In that week, I didn't feel comfortable and didn't enjoy myself, even though I was on a beautiful island and life should've been great. This shows that even if I do go on a trip, it's not guaranteed that I am happy.

Now my friend asked me if I want to go to India with her in July. She is going in any case, and an other friend of ours is going as well. The travel agency has a limit of people that can go and that limit is reached now, but I can still join if I decide today. However, I just don't know what I want anymore. It's a lot of money to go there (+2000) and it would come from my savings account. I've been struggling with handling money recently and I try to spend as little as possible. It causes me to decide not to do things that are fun and make me happy. It also causes me to be a cheapskate and this has an impact on my relationships with friends. I buy the cheapest drinks and food and I don't do certain activities to save money. This makes it hard for me to justify using my savings for a trip that isn't my dream or plan.

If my friend hadn't asked me, I would not have thought about going there now because it simply isn't the time as I don't have a lot of money in my bank account. Although I do have the amount of money that I need, my savings, so it is possible to go.

It is also possible to go time-wise, as I am currently taking a gap year, trying to figure out what I want in life. I would like to do a voluntary internship but I still have to apply for one and be accepted. I would like to find an internship abroad so I can get to know myself better and explore Europe more. However, if I don't get a scholarship for this, I told myself I wasn't able to do it. Now this decision about the trip to India made me realise that it is still possible if I don't get a scholarship, if I use my savings. And this would be a better investement in my career and future than a trip to India.

But the two previous trips I didn't do, have traumatised me to the point that I can't think clearly anymore. I'm absolutely lost and I don't know who I am or how to act. On the one hand, I'm not that excited to go there so I don't know if I should. On the other hand, I might never have this opportunity again. I will never have this many days off and free to go this far with that friend. And I'm so scared of missed opportunities. Will this be my life, a compilation of missed opportunities, of missed trips and missed chances of being happy? Or is my judgement clouded now with depression and sadness because of my previous missed trips, but should I not let this affect my future?

I'm lost. Can you help me out?

2022-10-11 22:23:24,reddit_post,"How do you feel about the romanticization/oversimplification of neurodivergence? Today and especially with social media it does seem certain mental disorders get romanticized or oversimpliflied. It hasn't happened to me much IRL but my mom is under the impression that because I am high functioning(never mind that psychologists stopped using the low/high functioning labels already) it means I ''barely have it'' or recently she suggested I might not be on the spectrum at all. Now let's just ignore the clear social difficulties I had throughout K-12, my crippling hyperfixations, rigid thinking She also still believes that we are like the guy from The Good Doctor in that we are really smart or intelligent or savants basically, or even saying most scientists are autistic. 

And I will say right now that is NOT true. I struggled alot in school especially with math, and even if I was supposedly some genius it hasn't been worth all the trouble not being able to socialize normally has brought to my life. I procrastinated alot and had trouble getting motivated in school and was a C student at best overall. I still struggle with self confidence and doubt because even if I know how to socialize with people much better that lack of experience in my formative years still mean I am not fully comfortable with people. Some within the autistic community want autism not seen as a disorder, but simply as a different form  of brain processing. This ignores not just severe cases where people are nonverbal and not capable of living independently, but even being a high-functioning'' guy this has been hell to grow up with. I still cringe at the nice guy phase I had in middle school, or how in high school I put some people off because I couldn't stop rambling about creepypastas or just droned on about social justice stuff.

It isn't just autism. People think OCD is being neat and well organized instead of the horribly intrusive thoughts and paranoia. Being clinically depressed is seen as being ''deep'' and ''insightful''(13 Reasons Why has gotten lots of flak) for this I think). I know there are also parent influencers who post about and make money off their neurodivergent kids, which aside from being exploitative also contributes to people not understanding how hard living and raising a kid with these conditions can be. I was a handful and got in trouble quite a bit when I was little, and my sister is bipolar depressive and the mood swings, violent outburst and suicide attempts on her part over the years were not fun(dad was the same with his temper, and even violent).


Even in terms of things I did like or was interested in(i.e. nerd stuff Star Wars etc) I couldn't really connect with people due to either talking about things in a narrow way or still just feeling literally exhausted trying and failing to connect with others. By senior year I still didn't have any real friends(only hung out with some kids outside of school literally a handful of times in 4 years) because aside from the hyperfixations I still just couldn't connect with people. So after graduation I had severe FOMO due to seeing others have a bunch of experiences to look back on and going to uni while I was still just lost.

Come post graduation I basically bungled my first year of CC due to poor planning and not focusing on the big picture and lamenting seeing my former peers have relationships or other things going on in their lives. And after getting into an EMT program that took longer than expected (COVID notwithstanding, I procrastinated and at first did a two semester program instead of a 5-10 week one), then took 3 tries and a few months to pass the national exam then left home for a bit due to family drama. Moved back, and then as of the start of this fall at the age of 22 I am now going back to school whereas others have graduated already or are closer to it. My focus is on online classes now as at this point I just want to get enough credits to apply for a park police job and finish the rest on the way.

Bottom line, I know I have to accept that this disorder is a apart of me I have to live with. But that's just it: it is a DISORDER. I shouldn't have been born this way and regardless of societal expectations or stereotypes, me/myself/I wish so badly I was neurotypical.  It has caused me more harm than good and no amount of uniqueness or supposed special ability(which I can't stress enough I don't even have) is worth all the trouble it has caused me. If I didn't have it, life wouldn't be perfect sure, but things like my family life and school would have been far easier to cope with and navigate.

2022-09-03 01:17:03,reddit_post,"Very scared/overthink when I try to make decisions? This is gonna be all over the place and not make any sense I guarantee lol.

I overthink choices so much now, I didn't in the past when I was little. 

for example, I'm almost done with high school. someone could ask what uni I want to go to, I honestly don't know. 

I'll start thinking about all the friends I could make in each uni, all the different experiences I will have in each one, how vastly different they are. and despite all that how I can only pick one 

and that means the friends, experiences, memories I would have made in the other universities don't exist in this time line

or say vacation, I don't know where I wanna go on vacation. I'm gonna have trouble picking a place because I'm gonna be thinking about all the fun/experience I'd have from the ones I didn't pick. Do I go to the beach? Do I go to the zoo? who will I meet if I go either today? what are the odds the person I accidentally bump into at the beach and laugh about it ends up being my one of my best friend for the next couple of decades? if I went to the zoo instead, I would have never met them, and that path would have never been discovered. I hate the randomness of life. even the  smallest decisions seem to have big results, positive or negative.  


I feel like this might be related to FOMO.  

 in a video game that involves choices or those old gamebooks, there are good choices and bad choices, good endings and bad ones. but when you get a bad ending, you can just go back and pick another option.

Life isn't like that, and I don't know why but it's taking a toll on me. not to mention the multiple good choices there are, and wanting the best one out of them all despite not knowing which one it is.

I want to befriend everyone, I want to experience everything, I wish I knew what outcomes I have in front of me before I had to make decisions",Veryscaredoflife,1

2022-09-03 01:54:14,reddit_comment,"When people say ""overthinking,"" they usually mean anxiety. I'll give you some anxiety information, but first I want to say that having some kind of plan for your future is very important,

I know that some people say you can think about that when you get to college, but all too often students procrastinate in college, the result being that they're not motivated for any of their courses.

For good motivation, you need to know that a course is taking you where you want to go.

Research this carefully. Find out what skills are in demand. US News and World Report has an annual book on colleges.

Most people with anxiety disorders do better with therapy (CBT) than with medicine, and some are successful with self-help based on CBT. I can show you some CBT self-help but first I want to say that recently there has been very impressive evidence for therapeutic breathing.

When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.

One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.

When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.

Don't make mountains out of molehills.

When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better.

Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.

The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.

Don't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.

Video - a lot of helpful information, including the 3-part program of Brown and Gerbarg -

So basically about a year ago i used to stay very depressed and was very emotional in terms of affection and feelings of loss and fomo . I had come off the back of a very intense weight loss and i guess that caused my hormones to fluctuate so fast forward 6 months i had that girl thing where you get attached and stuff and get your heart broken well after that i looked into how to improve well what that has lead to is me building muscle getting in good shape i don't make any money right now cause i have to attend mandatory college and i have been privileged enough to be born in a wealthy family .This routine of me fixing my body and skin and getting my sleep right has lead to an increase in testosterone in my body and now I'm very well . But here comes the problem for the past 4 months or so I've gotten very cold as in emotionless almost and not in the sense that i don't feel them but i know what's right and i don't act on it which I've noticed is weird for my age group for example i lost one of my 2 dogs and the 1st thing that came to my mind was "" he was old and wasn't of any use "" and then my uncle was suffering from financial issues and my family was like its normal and he's in his midlife crisis and my thoughts were no "" he's a bum who didn't sort his life out"" and I've gotten very ambitious to the point where I've gone from living life one step at a time to now planning 10 years in advance choosing my career very strategically as to what can help me make the most money irrespective of the morals and the ethics of the work and i don't know it's weird whatever I do I want more and I'm not happy with anything like if i get a piece of jewellery or clothing the next day I'm like now I want a better more expensive one i don't know what's happening. I quite like myself right now but I'm not happy and i have a very negative outlook on life like i work on my face as in orthotropics and stuff and if i see another person who's not i shape or looks half decent i just don't want to talk to them almost start hating them i don't know what this is .",Ok-Night-4551,2

I've always had problems meeting girls and dating because I'm a shy person and I have social anxiety. I lost my virginity very late in life at 22 years old. That also makes me feel like I'm a bit of a loser. Fast forward many years, I'm now an engineer with a stable job. I'm financially stable and I'm fortunate enough to be able to buy nice things, nice vacations, and even a small condo. I finally met the girl of my dream.

However, I still have very low self-esteem and often feel jealous of my girlfriend's past. She was a cool and popular girl in high school, she always had boyfriends and a great social life. It makes me feel like I'm just a lame guy compare to her. She was definitely a part of the cool kids group in high school that would reject nerdy people like me. I just feel uncomfortable and jealous. Even tho high school was such a long time ago, I still have FOMO and I wish I did the cool things like going to parties, going to prom, etc. For some reasons, I feel like the reason I have what I have now is because I'm successful in my career and I make decent money. I feel like people don't truly like me for who I am because no one liked me when I was that nerdy kid in high school and college. I felt alone and I always wished to have a relationship and a great social life since I was 15 but I never had it. I feel like a loser.

I know 23 isn't *that* old given that I have my whole career ahead of me, but I recently volunteered with some underprivileged elementary school students aged 6-10, and I felt somewhat jealous about how they are far more likely to live into the next century. 

I guess I'm getting insane FOMO. I find myself wishing that by the time I'm like 50, some sort of technology will exist to extend lifespan, but nobody can say that for sure. I suppose I take some comfort in knowing that millions of people have felt the same way throughout history like Ponce de Leon and his quest for the Fountain of Youth.

Me and my boyfriend are both in our late 20s and a few months ago during a really busy time of work for me, I went with my bf to his sister‚Äôs wedding (plane tickets were bought ahead of time even though I said I might not be able to go). Because of something unpleasant my SO‚Äôs mother said about me a week before the wedding and because I‚Äôm not that close with his side of the family, I wanted some liquor courage while at the wedding. Long story short I drank too much and blacked out during cocktail hour. My bf had to take care of me the whole time after (help me puke, make sure I was not kidnapped when knocked out in a corner cause I am a sleepy drunk) which resulted in him missing some of the special moments of the wedding such as the father daughter dance, being in a ton of photos, greeting guests around the tables with his family, etc. I understand that I messed up and wasn‚Äôt trying to drink until I blacked out but it just happened and I really wish I can reverse time and not drink at all but I can‚Äôt. My bf and I don‚Äôt really talk about the wedding much anymore, but when I bring it up, it seems he‚Äôs still not totally ‚Äùover it‚Äù and has a lot of fomo for missing out on some parts of the wedding.

tl;dr I want to get out of a state of fear of the future and fear of change.   
I might finally get employment soon and I'm very very scared of not knowing how it'll work out.

I'm just your average student looking for an internship so that I can finally be done with college.

After struggling with life purpose and finding out management was not for me, I enrolled into liberal arts with a focus on translation, then got into publishing graduate school cause I thought it was the area I disliked the least and stood some chance of eventually enjoying.

All this to get to now - I've driven myself in a corner, psychologically. Right now, I'm only seeing bad outcomes - either 1) I don't find an employer in time and will have to find one later, maybe even starting next fall or 2) I DO find an employer and then next week I'll be doing my second internship.

My issue is 1) means more time spent unemployed unless I go out of my way to find something, while 2) is the worse outcome according to my panicking ego, because ohmygod ohmygod I'm on track to graduation and I have to look for my first ""real"" job while working the current one.

&#x200B;

Whatever's manning my ship is mostly thinking short to midterm, has FOMO riding in the background 24/7 and would hate the idea of changing course, whether it is to consider alternate life paths now or after I get my ""real"" job.

In other words, I feel like a lazy coward and a complete moron for fantasizing about publishing not being my thing when it's only gonna be the 2nd internship, AND I've been told non-internships are very different from internships. I know nothing, and yet I pretend I already know the outcome.

Is there any way of getting out of this? I have contemplated just soldiering through and seeing how it works out, but then I feel like it'll be more painful if I decide it'll be okay and yet it isn't.

I've also been endlessly postponing on taking the time to introspect and decide some sort of life strategy. To the point that if some ""where do you want to be in three years"" scenario doesn't include a white collar job and creative writing/working with writers, I'm not even willing to consider it, regardless of how I truly feel about positions of higher responsibility or creative writing/working with writers.

Recently, I am living my dream life. I worked really hard to be where I am today, I worked from the bottom and built my life up. 

That said, I really want to share this joy with my close friends. But because of what I have been through, I'd see someone who has more success than me, I'd feel sad and bad about myself. I don't want my friends to look at me and be sad about their lives. This is why I usually keep everything to myself. My therapist encouraged me to share my joy, but I couldn't pass through the feeling of guilt like I am at fault because I am more successful (career-wise) than my friends.

I am so worried about fomo, what others think of me, and missing out; what‚Äôs really weighing me down right now is my living situation.

I am at college right now, in a long distance relationship. We see eachother once a month and I love him very much and when we are together, I am satisfied with our relationship. But, I am rooming with two other girls. These girls also have boyfriends, at our college. I like these boys, we are all friends, but they are constantly in the room.

I tell myself if I can just find the mental peace in myself, then I would be okay with them being there. They are busy during the day so the guys are normally in the room exclusively at night, and I love my roommates they are my best friends and I don‚Äôt even know where to begin to set boundaries with this situation. I just get discouraged to do my work with all these guys in the room, I just wish I could ignore them and not feel this way, I struggle so heavily with productivity as it is

Does anyone have any advice on how to increase productivity, to focus on ones self? I just want to focus on myself and bid away these bad emotions I just wish I knew how.

Sorry if this is all confusing. As i‚Äôm typing this literally all four of them are in the room right now. Again I don‚Äôt really know how to set boundaries for this situation and I feel too bad, but am I going insane to be feeling this way from all of this ü•≤",Potential-Abroad-880,1

So basically I'm 29 years old and don't have a job or anything else just for some background, I've suffered with mental illness since I was in my early teens, mostly just anxiety and or depression which I would say has a lot to do with my self image.  
Most of my time is spent on art of video games and kind of always had been, nowadays I'm almost too depressed to do anything apart from video games but the thing is I don't really like to play them alone, I like talking with friends and basically always need one online with me to enjoy anything which is where my struggle comes from.  
Lately I've been finding it harder and harder to enjoy anything and constantly rely on the one friend to help keep me entertained, I constantly ask them to play games and constantly keep an eye on my messenger app to see if I have a reply or have been asked myself.  
Every day I basically tell myself ""okay don't ask them until X o'clock, or wait until they ask me"" as part of me believes that they only play something with me because I ask, I've been doing this for weeks now and I feel like I'm becoming super reliant on this person and hard to just step away from the digital spaces we hang out in. I know this is super unhealthy and I just want to feel somewhat normal in my daily habits, but I get super FOMO when I do anything else and feel like if I miss one thing people will just forget about me and then I will have 0 friends.   


I know none of this is super realistic and even though I'm aware of it I can't just put the phone down and stop waiting for messages like a weirdo. Has anyone had a similar experience or any help in any form for me? I would greatly appreciate it.",Mentalhethaway,3

- I always think people are talking trash behind my back if I‚Äôm the first to leave (no one is)

2021-04-02 01:17:48,reddit_post,"Overthinking is ruining my life Long story short, I‚Äôm a 20 year old socially anxious shut-in NEET who‚Äôs been neglecting every aspect of his life for years.

I came to the conclusion that overthinking is the source of all my problems. I also fall prey to perfectionism, analysis paralysis, Information overload and FOMO.

The problem is that these counterproductive thinking patterns prevent me from attempting to overcome them. It‚Äôs Catch-22. There are countless resources on overcoming perfectionism and overthinking, which is overwhelming, so avoid it entirely. 

I can‚Äôt move forward in life because there is too many options in how I can move forward. For example, I neglect my health because I feel lost in the sea of information on diet, exercise and my ailments. And I haven‚Äôt even begun tackling a big financial decision I should have made months ago. 

I question everything. I can‚Äôt be certain of anything. I‚Äôm paralyzed and I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind. I ponder pointless questions like ‚ÄúIs there objective truth?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow can I be sure of anything?‚Äú or ‚ÄúWhy do anything?‚Äù.

My problem is not that I‚Äôm unable to push myself to do things, but that I‚Äôm unable to convince myself that an action is correct. I even discard personal experience e.g. I know that good sleep and going on walks make me feel a lot better, but it‚Äôs not enough for my brain to be convinced that I shall focus on building these habits. 

After my only close friend, who could motivate me to act in spite of my indecisiveness, had left me, I just gave up on attempting to better myself. Even since then, I couldn‚Äôt convince myself to do anything other taking care of hygiene. 

How do I find the basis, the justification for doing anything? How do I become convinced, certain of something? It seems like I cannot prevent doubt from originating and I cannot force myself to believe something. 

I saw two therapists so far, but they were of little help. Please, internet strangers, give me some pointers.",overthinkoverthink,20

2021-10-07 07:25:38,reddit_post,"Input would be helpful Hello,

I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm advance if I make a lot or some error when it comes to English it‚Äôs not my first languages.

Background: I‚Äôm a 21 yo male that is currently living on my own in an apartment that I recently bought. I‚Äôm living here with my cat and my life has been good. I come from a strict but fair upbringing with both of my parents and a younger brother. We are a upper middle class family that has been grateful to enjoy vacations to both snowy and warm climates. As mentioned before we‚Äôre upper middle class but was never just given stuff for free we had to work for everything we wanted. But we ofc got gifts and packages during our birthdays and Christmas. My parents has been super supported threw my entire life and always prioritized spending time with me and my younger brother. During my life I have never had problems with making friends or talking to girls.

The beginning: to my memory it started when I was around 13yo and you had the option to choose a secondary language that will later add extra points when keep moving forward in our school system. I took the easy road and choose just go keeps practicing English and Swedish ( this class didn‚Äôt really do that it was just looking at YouTube and fooling around wich I knew ). After about 1 year had passed I started having almost panic or regret of not taking a language that would help my school career almost like FOMO. It might sound stupid but I thought my life was over and felt really bad about it all. I started having suicide thoughts and started taking long walk very late threw places I knew was dangerous and with hope of getting killed or hurt etc to make the pain stop. It was at this time to started seeking our either songs or movie characters that was really sad or heartbroken.

 I started feeling like a zombie with no emotions almost. Or I could feel happy or sad time to time but it‚Äôs hard to remember. Either way after opening up to my parents about all this they was very supportive and did research up the thing I was worried about. It later came up that the choice I made didn‚Äôt really make a big difference as I thought. And the feelings of sadness started going away. 

Fast forward about 3 years and I‚Äôm starting having feelings of hopelessness and sadness for no apparent reason that I could think about. I once again talked with my parents about this and my mother offered to sleep next to her during the night and my dad take my bed so I don‚Äôt have to feel so lonely at night. It would get so bad that I would either stay home and just lay in my bed exhausted and sleeping. And if I went to school I would just go to bed as soon as I got home. Also during this time period I had good grades relationship in school with friends was great and life was supposed to be good. This went on for about 3-5months and during this time my parent took me to a psychologist. But when we got their I told everyone I felt better and was no longer feeling bad or had suicidal thoughts.

Resent years: after I graduated school with good grades I remember that I was happy and was but had no idea what I wanted do with my life. During the first weeks of school o mostly played video games with my friends and has a good time. After some time my dad told me I had to provide something to the household and since I didn‚Äôt have a job during the time he had me do work around the house wich I enjoyed, during this time I was job hunting but not really putting much effort into it. After some months my dad notified that his grandparents needed help with a bunch of stuff on their farm. So I switched and drove to them at monday and stayed until Thursday and the other days I drove home and had free time. This also went on for a couple of months until I started feeling the pressure from everyone round me to get a real job. This honestly really got to me and started feeling bad about not having a job ( I started feeling like I was leeching of my parent ). I land a job at a sales company that travel all around the country I‚Äôm living in ( Sweden ) I becomes one of the top 50 best salesmen‚Äôs in the entire Scandinavia and my sales coach and boss is showering me and say the see a great further in me. After some months I start getting tired of the traveling lifestyle ( we was abel to travel home but very very few times except for holidays ). I have a meeting with me boss where I say I‚Äôm no longer feeling the job anymore and want to quit. Both my boss and sales coach tries to get me to stay but I tell them no.

The reason I quit was because I had started having the thought of being a policeman since I love helping people. I was not in the best shape but when I get home I tell me parent about my goal and that I will have to train my body and strength to get excepted. I workout 5 days a week and walk 1-2 hours every day. I start loosing weight and gaining muscle and are getting very close to my goal.


- [ ] The hard crash: So me and my family was watching a movie and in the beginning it is on of those dots with a lot of colors ( that are used to determine color difficulties ) but I don‚Äôt know that and ask my parent why they had those dots and they said that it the film name displayed. My mind starts racing and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it and ask my parent about it and we go back and pause the frame. And I can‚Äôt see anything it‚Äôs just a sea of colors. I get the gut sinking feeling and tell my parent I have to do something and that they can watch the movie without me. I go up to my room and start doing research about if you need normal vision for getting accepted to the police academy. And yes their it is ‚Äúyou must have normal color vision to get accepted‚Äù this must have been the biggest reality check I ever got and my world comes crashing down on me. I start crying and just screaming WHY WHY WHY my little brother prob heard me and notified my parent wich came to comfort me. I‚Äôm still screaming and crying getting hugged by my dad. I wake up the next day with me dad still next to me, I‚Äôm now feeling like a zombie and this is where aloe get blurry. I feel like my life is over and I‚Äôm slowly starting to have suicidal thoughts again and at one night while I‚Äôm home alone I send my parents a goodbye SMS and trie to hang my self on my room. It fails and a this point my parent are spam calling me and I‚Äôm not responding. Few minutes goes boy and I‚Äôm now getting a call from the police, I‚Äôm still to afraid pick up the phone. Few more minutes passes and the police brakes into my house and takes my to a mental house or place where I spend a few weeks and then get released cuz the doctors can‚Äôt see anything wrong with me even tho I explained everything.

 Today: I after that land a job at good company and are super happy with the colleges and boss. I get a promotion and start working in a even more fun and better sector. I buy an apartment move out and start to live on my own. Life is good and is going great until a few days ago where I start having the and dark feelings again after work when I‚Äôm no longer busy or distracted. And I just can‚Äôt understand why? I have everything 99,9% of people would be happy with. I‚Äôm now starting to get scared",PODBOT-Fyrion,1

I always set myself high expectations, whether it's starting a new hobby or skill, work,  self care, social stuff... But whenever the time came to act, I'd procrastinate or quit almost instantly. I started to feel so guilty and useless.

I've been through therapy and I was diagnosed with ADHD at the start of the year. I realised that these expectations and goals I set myself weren't my own... they came from media.

I'm going through a bit of an identity crisis at the moment (why I found this subreddit). I'm having to relearn who I am, how my brain works and understand my new behaviour now I'm on all this medication.

I've deleted Facebook, Instagram and twitter, I've stopped following ""personalities"" on YouTube and podcasts, and now only focus on topics.

I can feel myself getting better overall, but it's still a bumpy journey. I'm procrastinating a lot less and I'm doing more things that offer real personal value... For example, I've started reading books, which doesn't sound like much but I've never done it before and it's replaced like 90% of the time I would normal spend on my phone. 

I'm not suggesting you get rid of social media or that you have ADHD... But I think you need to figure out what YOU WANT and not what everyone else is telling you to want.

And you probably already know that, but based on you've raised in your OP, I think there's a difference between 'intellectually knowing' and 'emotionally knowing'... If that makes sense üòÇ",ilikestuff94,2

2021-09-05 02:09:15,reddit_post,"How do I overcome a completionist mindset? I feel like I am missing out on a lot of things by not learning French. As you can infer from my profile and post history, I‚Äôm a language learner trying to master 3 languages. I‚Äôm not in this for fun or just to prepare for some 3-day trip, I actually want to be really f****** good  at all 3 languages. I‚Äôve decided to dedicate my life to this labour (sounds cult-like, I know, but I really feel a strong sense of passion for what I‚Äôm doing) (that is, I don‚Äôt aspire to be the idiots who claim to speak 20 languages but can only utter a few simple words and phrases). And after that, maybe I‚Äôll learn a couple more- French or Russian perhaps?

It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm terrible at them: for Spanish, I‚Äôve reached a pretty good level- for those who know the CEFR scale, it‚Äôs around the C1 level, while for Italian and Portuguese, I do have an intermediate level when it comes to writing and listening and reading comprehension, but I struggle with speaking at times. 

However, I feel a little (actually, very) FOMO because I‚Äôm not learning French I‚Äôve explored a little French culture (I love the few songs I‚Äôve listened to). I don‚Äôt care that everyone is learning French apart from me- that‚Äôs besides the point. For me, the interest is there- just that, in the quest to be near-perfect in all 3 of my current languages, it‚Äôs difficult to fit in another language (imagine remembering 20+ words from 4 languages everyday+ media immersion). This is not a question of goals either (I am learning languages for the sole purpose of learning the language- anything else is a result of that).

The Francophone world also seems so huge- I‚Äôm missing out on so much culture, media, literature. It sucks. I thumbed through Le Figaro (France‚Äôs national newspaper) and I see all this content that I‚Äôm never going to be able to access.

My routine (so you understand why I feel this way- it‚Äôs hard to squeeze in another language this way, isn‚Äôt it? ): I go all-out to study and try my very best at all 3 languages. I read multiple newspapers from 4-5 different countries EVERYDAY, listen to podcasts in each language, write at least a 200-word essay EVERY SINGLE DAY ( in BOTH Italian and Portuguese, the weaker languages), and try to squeeze in a couple of hours of speaking practise, if time and energy level permits. I‚Äôve essentially transformed my routine into one reminiscent of a military base/camp, no frills with a lot of drills- at least for now.

*I don‚Äôt learn languages to stop halfway- that is to say, I‚Äôm not willing to learn any language just to learn basic phrases, words and grammar- If I‚Äôm learning, I‚Äôm learning all the way and for life. 

** If you say- why not just watch X movie with subs or read X book in English- my response is: I treat this like a game- that is to say, everything is locked and I can‚Äôt access it until I LEARN the language. Besides, dubbing and subs and translations suck.

2021-04-05 16:08:25,reddit_post,"My experience with Mental Health improving exercises For the past few months, I've been trying to improve my mental health and general wellbeing with different exercises that are supposed to have a positive effect on your mental health, or reduce symptoms of depression. I thought I'd share my experiences and what's worth trying so you don't have to try them all yourself.

* Running

10/10 - If you feel capable, start running. I did this a few times a week for a month and it made me feel more of a sense of accomplishment than I've felt in a long time. Whenever I was feeling down I'd try and go out for a run straight away, put a podcast on or some music, and work up a sweat. You come back tired but with an endorphin rush. It surprised me how well this worked.

* Healthy Eating

4/10 - Obviously it depends what you're struggling with, but eating healthy food didn't really help me at all. The one benefit is the great feeling you get when you cook something delicious that's healthy, but most of the time I wasn't feeling up for cooking anyway, so would just have some chicken and rice, which is boring. Balanced diet with some actual flavour and occasionally treating yourself >>>

* No Alcohol

6/10 - I tend to drink quite a lot, and thought it might have caused some of my mental health struggles. However, when I stopped drinking for a month, I felt slightly disassociated with friends, and got pretty bad FOMO because of that. I did lose some weight from it though, which did improve self-confidence.

More detail on the first three can be found in this [video](https://youtu.be/SWqSLhBGUl8)

* Meditating

8/10 - definitely worth giving this a go. Taking a bit of time out of the day is really useful for just resetting yourself and dealing with particular stresses. I'd recommend doing one or two 10 minute periods a day, and try doing it when you're wide awake. I was doing this 5 times a day and sometimes when I was tired, I fell asleep during the exercise, which kind of ruined the experience (unsurprisingly). More info [here](https://youtu.be/ipuzCrqxzNA)

* Journaling

5/10 - didn't really rate this for myself, but there was a lot of research showing the benefits. I tried using a guided journal and I think that might've been my downfall. I know this really works for a lot of people but it actively dragged up some old issues for me and on occasion made me feel worse. I think if you do this with a few other exercises, or if writing really helps to get things off your chest then it's worth trying though. Again, if you want more info on my journaling experience, that can be found [here](https://youtu.be/d4npVJi4A7s)

2021-01-06 04:38:36,reddit_post,"Happiness in Life (85) We are all carrying around daily baggage; stressors, anxieties, money payments, tasks that need to be accomplished, goals, our love life etc etc. With all these constant feelings of worry and pain, its easy to lose track and forget what the meaning of life is, **gratitude of the present moment, to be alive in itself.**

We are constantly consuming social media, news, articles, movies, tv shows; having those ""fomo"" *Fear Of Missing Out*, feelings, that remember, we allow ourselves to feel. We all think that we all have to be aware of everything new that is happening, the latest album, the latest netflix show, the latest person that went viral, the latest artist, the latest clothing release, the latest new thing that we MUST have, but do we ever stop and ask ourselves why? Why have we been conditioned to feel this way? Why have we allowed ourselves to be conditioned this way? Why have we never taken a step back and realized that life is still happening, even if we have no idea of the ""new"" it thing?

Up until a few years ago, I had always been a subject to this. Always wanting to be ""apart of the crowd"", not missing out because I thought that I'd be looked at as ""weird"" ""a loser"" ""strange"" ""out of it"" etc etc. Until I realized, when we are **ALL** focusing on not missing out on ""the new thing"", what is really happening is that we are missing out on ourselves. Missing out on our life right now. Missing out on the **present moment.** Missing out on waking up and saying wow, **I am alive**, I was allowed to start a new day, which ultimately is more important than any ""trend"", any ""new thing"" etc. 

Now realizing that we have been conditioned to forget the true **meaning of life**, which is **happiness, family, gratitude, empathy, kindness, perspective, joy and presence, we can change that**. It may honestly feel overwhelming or even uncomfortable to start focusing on these aspects of life that make us, **human.** We have to start and we have to start **today.** As we have seen in the last almost year, our world has changed and will consistently change in this coming year. Remember that being aware of whats to come may cause fear for a brief moment, but of course it will, when we have been shown otherwise our whole life. 

Take a breath. Take a moment for yourself. Meditate Daily. Pray Daily. When we are connected with God, Jesus, the Universe, the Most High; we are putting all of our faith and life into everything above this planet, rather than other human beings that are just like us, something else that I can get into it, but we will save that for another day.

**Today:** Get fresh air. Get outside. If you haven't meditated before, go to youtube and search ""Meditation for Beginners"". It will make you feel uncomfortable but anything that pushes comfort zones is actually what is meant for us, in this present moment and whats meant for us for our longevity. Pray as well. Ask for Guidance. Ask for Help. I believe in you. With all of us, changing the way we think, act, feel with ourself, that will then lead to us changing together. **Together, Separately.**

**I love you.**

2021-08-04 03:17:46,reddit_post,"My experience on Zoloft - is it a good fit? This is my second time posting about zoloft and I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts or explanations as to what's going on.

Background: I am tentatively diagnosed with bipolar but my new psychiatrist does not think so.  All throughout high school / college, I trudged along, unmotivated, not getting out of bed etc.  I felt sane but was what I thought was depressed (lack of friends).  Then I hit my senior year of college, met great friends and it's been uphill until my ""manic"" phase where I was in a state of gogogo, my world turned upside down and I started getting anxiety attacks etc. It hasn't exactly been the same since then, I've been going between wanting to sleep in and wanting that gogogo mentality.

Zoloft, 25mg for 2 weeks, then 50mg for 3 weeks.

25 mg - felt like my 20s, energy, motivation, openness, wanting to socialize, etc.  I was looking into hiking, hanging out etc.  I still had social anxiety by people pleasing and getting anxious.  FOMO was what got me going.

50 mg - felt like my high school days, except I wouldn't label it ""depression"".  I literally didn't care about anything.  I called out sick because I didn't feel like getting up.  My social anxiety came out as I hated people, didn't want to socialize with them.  But I wasn't suffering emotionally, I just accepted myself for who I was and move on.  Without any anxiety, I was free to do whatever I wanted.  My overthinking from panic became detail orientedness and organized.  Outdoorsy mentality went out the window to more fashion and beauty.  I no longer had FOMO and looked inwards rather than out.

It's like I've lived two separate lives and a 25mg difference flipped it from one end to another, 180 degrees.  What is going on?",shufflemania537,1

2021-07-05 11:07:53,reddit_post,"Unsure if I have clinical depression Hi folks. 

For about 7 years now, I‚Äôve felt general depression like symptoms that may or may not be associated with depression: 

1) low self esteem, 
2) general FOMO and always feeling like I am receiving the short end of experiences or no experiences at all 
3) resentment without cause towards successful people or for acquaintances  that I interact with (attractive people in particular) 
4) getting upset and impatient when I am not where I want to be in life
5) more introverted behaviour than I probably would be otherwise displaying. 
6) General anxiety when engaging socially with others 
7) resort to escapism when upset
8) when at social events, get upset and think about the past about the lack of social experiences and how unfair life is 
9) never taking a compliment and always finding ways to disprove that

There were times it wasn‚Äôt always like this, that‚Äôs what makes me skeptical about my own diagnoses. Some of the things I described above have been on and off. Although as of late, I have felt all of that. 

Your thoughts would be very much appreciated. Should I get a diagnoses?

2021-04-27 02:45:14,reddit_post,"Suicidal Ideation & Severe Depression I feel like my life is basically over. Or at least my life as it once was. I used to have a lot of friends, and was on track to get my AA and a degree in music education at my local college. Before covid I had a huge emotional breakdown at school which caused me to withdraw from 3 of my required music classes. Then the world closed up. In the meantime, I worked on myself. My mental health got better,  I was took a few gen ed classes, and I was able to see my friends, just not as frequently. I was also crushing on one of my friends who was quarantined and used eventually seeing them as an excuse to keep me going. Things seemed ok. 

I don't know why the thought of the world opening up makes me incredibly anxious, but it does. I'm lowkey scared to go back into a routine because I feel like I have regressed, as I've adapted to the comfort of staying at home and not having to get dressed/put on makeup every day. It feels like it will be a huge struggle to go back to life as it once was. I can't get vaccinated either because of bad reactions in the past, and I'm scared that nobody will want to hang out with me because of that. I already have terrible FOMO from being excluded as a child, so this is making it worse. I have this horrible fear that all of my friends will start to forget about me, which looks like it has already happened. I also realized that I only crushed on my friend for so long because I knew I would never love anybody like that ever again(I'm highly selective & it takes me a looong time to fall in love with people), and I'm so desperate for any kind of physical contact. Everyone I know has been in relationships/hookups/situationships and it feels like there is something wrong with me for never getting to experience that. 

It really sucks seeing people my age and younger are making the most of their lives in a pandemic, while I am stuck here doing nothing. Social media has definitely not helped me. Everytime I log on to instagram and see 18-year-old girls who wear cute outfits and make friends and smoke weed and hook up in a pandemic, it fills me with rage. I feel like I have missed out on so much of my life already, and I am only 20. I think I have actually mentally impaired myself from all of this comparing and telling myself I'm not shit. I honestly believe there isn't a single thing I'm good at, and it's too late for me to start anything new(I've wanted to be a musician/music producer for the longest time but everyone I look up to has been making music since they were like 12). Even doing basic tasks is hard for me. 

Sometimes when I'm in a depressive spell, I make a list of things to look forward to. My most recent list had getting a crepe from a restaurant, my brother's high school graduation and my best friend's 21st birthday. Passing my classes is on there too. Right now I'm only taking 2 classes and struggling in them, while everyone else I know is trying their best and taking a full courseload. It feels like I can't even celebrate getting though my classes anyway because 1) they're not hard 2)i didn't try 3)my parents ~~held my hand~~ helped me. 

I just want to curl up into a ball and dissociate myself from the rest of the world, since it's easier than the ugly mess that will be me trying to accommodate to a routine again. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live either. I just feel like a sad excuse for a human being.",Middle-Remote,1

I just want to start off by saying I don't really use reddit, its more of a thing I do on the side if I get bored. But, I've had a lot of repressed feelings stuck in my head for a long time, so I thought this would be a great place to start. 

I pretty much just came here to say is I do not know how much I can last being a loner. I'm male (18y) and I'm in a College right now, with pretty much only online classes. With COVID, it really set back the social events at my school and because of that setback, me and a lot of other students are suffering from crippling loneliness. I'm not sure how long I'm going to last in quarantine, just because the isolation has really started to eat away at me. I don't even remember how I was before this all started and now, my mental state just keeps plummeting. 

Being a loner sucks because I want to do so much, but I just don't have the time, circumstances or the people to do it with. Being stuck with just me and my thoughts, with no one to talk to about it, and having a serious case of FOMO (Fear.Of.Missing.Out).  

I just want this to be over, ever since I graduated and with COVID impacting every aspect of life for me, I hate being a college student so far. And I hate being stuck with just me, and I don't think I can last much longer.",_IcarusIsFalling_,3

* Garden/Take Care of Houseplants
* Sing Out Loud 
* Organize and Declutter
* Dance Around your Home
* Take a break from social media
* Cook a healthy meal
* Do a 10-minute workout  


## Garden/Take Care of Houseplants

 [Several studies have shown that gardening has numerous health benefits](https://www.healthline.com/health/healthful-benefits-of-gardening#helps-fight-disease). For starters, pulling weeds and planting plants can be hard work! Exhausting yourself and getting exercise can help improve your sleep which is pivotal for positive mental health. Additionally, being outside in the sun allows the body to generate vitamin D. Vitamin D is essential for health and r[ecent studies on covid-19 have shown that vitamin D deficiency can increase covid-19 risks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-77093-z).   
Gardening has also been used to help treat addictions like alcoholism.¬†[**Horticulture therapy**](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/03/health/sw-horticultural-therapy/index.html)¬†has been used for decades and is backed by serious science.¬†[**This study published on ResearchGate even discusses which plants work best to evoke positive and therapeutic sensation**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321134657_The_use_of_sensory_perception_of_plants_in_horticultural_therapy_of_alcohol_addiction_Journal_of_Therapeutic_Horticulture_272_-_2017_ISSN_2381-5337). The participants in the study ranked sunflower, chili pepper, lavender, lemon balm, sweet basil and wild chive as some of the most therapeutic and sensory-pleasing plants.

## Sing loud and proud

There are multiple health benefits to singing. Singing and/or making music exercises the brain and can¬†[**release neurochemicals such as**¬†](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01096/full)[**Œ≤-endorphin**](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01096/abstract), one of the compounds that acts as a natural pain blocker.¬†[**A study published in**¬†***Trends of Cognitive Sciences***¬†**shows evidence that singing is good for posture and breathing as well as mental focus**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364661305002901). It is also believed that regularly memorizing new songs can help prevent mental decline in old age too. Don't know what to sing? Top hits from my singalong list include:

***Bohemian Rhapsody***¬†by QUEEN

***Total Eclipse of the Heart***¬†by Bonnie Tyler

***Don‚Äôt Stop Me Now***¬†by Queen

***My Life Would Suck Without You***¬†by Kelly Clarkson

***Don‚Äôt Stop Believing***¬†by Journey

***I Get Around***¬†by The Beach Boys

## Organize Collections and Declutter

Even if it is just for 5‚Äì10 minutes, decluttering can be a little accomplishment that reduces anxiety and snowballs into feelings of productivity that can carry the rest of the day. There are known benefits of tidying up, and s[**tudies have shown that clutter competes for attention in the brain and can lead to stress and overconsumption of food and media**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2711870). If you don‚Äôt know where to start, I recommend making a declutter-list. On it put each room in your home and add a few bullet points of things that need to be cleaned/declutterd. Then try to check off one room every week until the place is clutter-free.

## Dance around your home

I love dancing and have done it since I was a kid. It is no secret that moving around and getting exercise is great for the body and mind.¬†[**A Swedish study published in ScienceNordic looked at more than 100 teenage girls who struggled with mental health issues like anxiety and depression**](https://sciencenordic.com/adolescent-girls-dancing-depression/teen-girls-dance-away-the-blues/1379230). In the study, one group attended weekly dance classes and the other half did not. The study not only showed the girls who took the dance classes improved their mental health and mood, but also concluded that the positive effects lasted up to eight months after the dance classes ended.

## Take a break from social media

Limit it to 30 minutes a day if you feel depressed or anxious that day. A study published in¬†[**Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology**](https://guilfordjournals.com/journal/jscp)¬†concluded that limiting use of social media can result in less feelings of loneliness and depression. Additional studies have shown spending too much time on social media can¬†[**drive the**¬†***fear of missing out***¬†**(FOMO) and can leads to self comparison with peers and ‚Äúinfluencers.‚Äù**](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/social-media-use-increases-depression-and-loneliness)¬†Influencers on social media tend to flaunt a life-style that many of us wish we could have. The thing is, a¬†[**large portion of the glam-life portrayed on social media is fake**](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/12/influencers-are-faking-brand-deals/578401/)¬†and done for clout.

## Cook a healthy meal

There are tons of benefits to cooking healthy meals including improved sleep and focus. Eating low-carb meals can help¬†[**reduce appetite and promote weight-loss**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12430970/), according to numerous studies. Also,¬†[**Ketogenic diets**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet)¬†have even been used to¬†[**treat epilepsy in children who don‚Äôt respond well to medication**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1474442208700929). Once you start cooking, you realize¬†[**a ton of meals can be done in 10 minutes or less**](https://www.thekitchn.com/10-minute-dinners-22932001), and only require 1 pan so easy cleanup. My go-to 10 minute meal is shrimp and broccoli.

## Do a 10-minute workout

A study published in the journal¬†[**Plos One showed that short but intense workouts could be as beneficial as long workouts for maintaining health**](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0154075). The study looked at 3 groups of sedentary men. The control group made no changes to their habits. The other two groups were made to exercise. One group did a moderate cycling routine lasting 50 minutes while the last group did a 10 minute cycling routine that included intermittent 20 second bursts of maximum intensity cycling. The study concluded that¬†[**high-intensity interval training**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training)¬†may result in similar or superior improvements in multiple aspects of health.

If you don‚Äôt have workout equipment, there are¬†[**tons of online resources that explain how to do body-weight workouts**](https://www.google.com/search?q=body+weight+workouts)¬†consisting of things like deep squats, planks and pushups. I keep a 15lb, 20lb and 25lb kettlebell in my home office and love to do some curls and kettlebell swings before zoom meetings to get my blood flowing and reduce my anxiety.

2020-11-28 05:35:31,reddit_post,"How to change an unwanted habit without 'will power', guilt or external motivation - in 30 days It took me < 2 min/day for a month to change my phone usage from 5hrs/day to 1hr/day. 

I was sick of how much time I was spending on my phone: easily 4-5 hours a day. 

In Dr. David R Hawkins‚Äô book *The Map of Consciousness Explained,* he explains a technique to get rid of *any unwanted habit*. It sounded easy so I decided to try it out. 

First, about the technique, itself.

Here‚Äôs what is needed:

&#x200B;

* Intention  
 
* A calendar  
 
* A couple of minutes every day for a month  
   
 

**How it works: the Heisenberg principle in action**

You‚Äôve probably come across this principle either from Breaking Bad or quantum physics, so I‚Äôll skip the science and cut to how it applies to us: 

&#x200B;

* The observer has an effect on the *observed*  
 
* Therefore, to witness a thing or event is to introduce the power of consciousness which influences the outcome by virtue of itself  
 

Or simpler still:

>**Our attention follows our intention.**   
>  
>**We impact whatever we choose to focus our attention on.**¬†

&#x200B;

**Putting it in action**

So let‚Äôs first chalk up what our *intention* is.

Let‚Äôs say we *love* cookies. So much that we just can‚Äôt stop eating them.¬†But this bothers us. So, *our intention is to have fewer cookies.* 

Instead of beating ourselves up for lacking will-power or sticking to a diet, we do this:

**At the end of each day we write down the number of cookies we ate in a calendar** ‚úçÔ∏è

>*Monday - 24 cookies. (Hmm)*  
*Tuesday - 16 cookies. (Good day)*  
*Wednesday - 29 cookies. (Bad me)*  
*Thursday - 20 cookies‚Ä¶ and so on*

**We do this every day for a month.** 

**That‚Äôs it.** 

What eventually happens is that our *intention* (to eat fewer cookies) takes over as we bring our *attention* to what we repeatedly do, i.e. eating cookies.

By default, our mind likes to push into ignorance or denial that which is unpleasant (about us). 

In contrast, bringing our habits into conscious awareness is like shining a bright light on previously dark corners.

>**As we begin to see and realize what we repeatedly do‚Äìwithout needing self-shaming and blame‚Äìthe power of awareness automatically begins to exert influence on our behaviour and impulses**

&#x200B;

After a couple of weeks, as we routinely reach for the box of cookies, a new awareness begins to show up replacing the earlier impulse. Thoughts like these may come up:

*‚ÄúDo I really need these 5 cookies right now? How about an apple instead?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúWhat else would I rather be doing than eating right now?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll treat myself to a couple of cookies at the end of the day‚Ä¶‚Äù*

We won‚Äôt need to *force* any change in our behaviour because consciousness itself will take care of this by *its intrinsic power.*

After a month we might just say, *to hell with the cookies, I‚Äôm actually better off doing \_\_\_\_.*

**Proof of the‚Ä¶cookie**

So, back to a month ago, I finally got fed up with the amount of time I was spending each day on the phone. I‚Äôm embarrassed to say that it was 30+ hours a week.

&#x200B;

>It affected the quality of time spent with family  
   
>  
>It nurtured FOMO like nothing else. *There‚Äôs always more left to read, scan, bookmark, share‚Ä¶*  
   
>  
>At the end of a phone-heavy day I felt the opposite of content  
 

So I started noting the screen-time at the end of every day on the calendar‚Äìwithout judgement or stress. I have an app that tells me that, so it‚Äôs pretty effortless.

*Day 1 - 5 hours (ugh)*

*Day 2 - 4.5 hours (nice)*

*Day 3 - 6.5 hours (good God!)*

 After doing this experiment for nearly a month, here‚Äôs a snapshot of how my daily phone usage changed:

Here's a screenshot: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/1gickxqr3p7q46s/phone%20tracking%20screenshot.png?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1gickxqr3p7q46s/phone%20tracking%20screenshot.png?dl=0)

Will I continue tracking this? Yes, because it doesn‚Äôt take more than a minute at the end of the day. Will I apply it to more unwanted habits? For sure. 

**Is there a habit you really want to change?** 

I know it sounds too good to be true, but I‚Äôm not here to sell you anything. 

Just set your intention, find a calendar and give it a go. I‚Äôd love to know how it work for you.

1. FOMO
2. Clickbait
3. Being manipulated into forming our opinions on something based on how many likes/retweets it gets.

>Having said that, I put together some [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) filters that remove a lot of that noise, aiming to make Twitter a more peaceful place to stay connected to people.

* The ‚ÄúWho to follow‚Äù section: suggests people based on your views, making echo chambers even worse.
* The likes/retweets count of posts.
* The ‚Äú\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ liked this‚Äù posts in your feed. This essentially makes it harder to have control over what you see, as it litters your feed with posts you didn‚Äôt ask for.

(17M) During this whole lockdown thing (UK, Nottingham) I was slowly getting closer to this girl I used to like and got denied by about 9 months ago. I started to develop feelings again but I know for a fact she has no interest back. She‚Äôs in my close friends group so I see her all the time and she‚Äôs one of my best friends so I don‚Äôt want to get rid of the relationship so that I can be happy again because she makes me both happy to be around but feel like shit whenever I realise I like her and she doesn‚Äôt like me back. When I say like I mean she‚Äôs literally the perfect human and I haven‚Äôt seen anything wrong before, it‚Äôs more like I‚Äôm in love with her more than just like her and it‚Äôs just shit.

It‚Äôs probably not a mental health issue and just heartbreak or some shit like that so sorry for wasting your time but here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been like because of this whole situation.

Every night after I‚Äôve been on a Group FaceTime or met up with her (5 times a week) I‚Äôve had this constant sadness that I can feel in my heart and body which just makes me feel like shit. I have to take a smile in front of my parents and I have to keep making myself smile and laugh during the day just so I can be happy

I have no motivation at all to do a level work and am extremely far behind and Ik I‚Äôm on a path to failure but I don‚Äôt know how to tell myself to start doing work.

I feel like I am a failure in every way possible, I hate how I look, my personality, my body and I can‚Äôt change any of it which crushes me knowing I can‚Äôt change this hatred

I‚Äôve had some suicidal thought but I know I‚Äôd never go through with it, I just want an excuse to escape everything.

It‚Äôs affecting my life atm massively and idk what to do about it or where I should ask on reddit or what to even do and I put this on here to ask for any help I could

Avoiding her isn‚Äôt really an option because she goes to anything any of my friends go to and I have awful fomo due to bullying and being left out of every activity and never being invited anywhere by my old friend group

          I'm a teenager going into my junior year of high school. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in 8th grade and have been on meds for it ever since. However, since then I have felt bouts of feeling like everyone finds me super annoying, i'm missing every opportunity life throws at me, and that I have the charm of a late introduced sitcom character. I also find I have a very hard time making even decisions on the spot, dealing with unforeseen circumstances, and getting severe cases of FOMO.

2020-05-26 06:39:15,reddit_post,"Any advice on how to overcome anxious/preoccupied attachment? So here‚Äôs a short-ish autobiography to provide some context. During my mom‚Äôs pregnancy with me, my dad had an affair. After I was born, my dad came back, my grandma asked my mom to forgive him for my sake. I feel it would‚Äôve been better if they hadn‚Äôt gotten back together and I was just raised by my mom alone, but they got back together. My mom was actually the main breadwinner of the family, while my dad ‚Äústayed at home‚Äù and gambled and misspent our money.

It was a loveless union, there was so much arguing and fighting going on as I was growing up. I was a relatively carefree child, and was relatively pampered with material goods, but I didn‚Äôt get much attention from either parent. My dad wasn‚Äôt very affectionate, and my mom was busy working at our family-owned convenience store.But when I was 10, my dad had another affair, and it was a messy separation of him leaving, me going back and forth between my parents, him coming back, then ultimately leaving again. 

I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but I think this is when my attachment issues started. Something had changed. I felt more distant from my friends and classmates, and became more of a loner. I didn‚Äôt really have any close friends at this time. I was also a closeted queer at the time, had body image issues, and got bullied by the other guys at school for being effeminate. I never felt like I ‚Äúbelonged‚Äù as part of any group of people, and I guess that sense of belonging is something I‚Äôve craved. Whenever I feel excluded from a social event or not invited to something, I‚Äôll experience major FOMO and feel irrationally sad and salty about it.

This is also when something I call ‚Äúthe cycle‚Äù started. It goes like this. I‚Äôd meet new people, and I naturally connect with people very well, so we‚Äôd get close really quickly. However, as time passed, it seemed like the relationship would die down, and I would find myself feeling insecure and needy for attention. I‚Äôd keep thinking about the person, and whenever they seemed to be ignoring me or talking to or hanging out with other people and not me, I‚Äôd get passive aggressive, angry, or do stupid shit to get their attention. After doing these things, I‚Äôd deeply regret doing that stuff and apologize for it, but this erratic behaviour would eventually drive people away. I‚Äôd keep asking myself ‚ÄúWhy am I like this?‚Äù, because I knew my actions were toxic and wrong, but I couldn‚Äôt control it. The rational side of me would know so-and-so was busy, but the emotional beast would tell me ‚Äúoh they‚Äôre ignoring you. You‚Äôre not good enough for them‚Äù.

It‚Äôs happened many times, from middle school onward to the present day (I‚Äôm 24 now). It happens most intensely with people I have a romantic interest in, but can happen with anyone I talk to a lot. It most recently ended with my first boyfriend. It was a long-distance relationship and he was busy, but I thought I could finally break the cycle with him, but I never fully communicated this neediness with him, worried it would scare him away, but eventually all the passive-aggressiveness and saltiness did that anyways. Often after these cycles, I‚Äôd spiral into depression, thinking that I couldn‚Äôt or didn‚Äôt deserved to be loved by others.

My mom also seemed to undergo changes from the separation. She became a lot moodier. I suspect it could be bipolar disorder or some type of undiagnosed mental condition. Sometimes she was very supportive and caring, but other times she‚Äôd become vicious, blaming me for things that were outside my control. One example is how during the financial crisis, she wanted to invest in real estate but didn‚Äôt have a broker nor was she proficient in English, so she wanted me, an eighth grader, to do it which is obviously silly. She continues to blame me for that to this day. Like a lot of Asian parents, she‚Äôs also quite controlling, and seems fixated on my appearance. I‚Äôm living at home after university right now and it‚Äôs been tough. For example, she insists on combing my hair her way everyday. 

TL;DR so it seems the lack of consistent affection in my childhood led me to have anxious attachment and preoccupied attachment. It seems that I gain too much of my self-confidence from others. I honestly haven‚Äôt been able to connect with ‚Äúmainstream gay culture‚Äù very well, because I know that with these attachment issues I can‚Äôt mentally deal with hookup culture, and I wonder if there are others out there that feel the same way.

However, I recognize that this is NOT who I want to be and that I can‚Äôt let it control me any longer. I recognize that I‚Äôve been asking myself the wrong questions. Instead of asking ‚Äúwhy am I like this?‚Äù I should be saying ‚ÄúOk this is not who I am. What can I do to tame this beast?‚Äù. Over the past year, especially with the help of that first relationship, I‚Äôve gained a lot of confidence in myself. I started a side gig running an e-commerce site, doing vlogging, and so on. Heck, it‚Äôs amazing that the guy who had too little self-esteem to hear his voice or watch himself on audio/video is doing these things. Recently, I‚Äôve started doing therapy sessions and have done a number of things to help deal with this. I‚Äôve been trying to heal that wounded inner child, and recently wrote a letter to 14 year old me. I‚Äôve also been trying to set more boundaries with my mom, more open with friends about these feelings, and being more critical when I find myself having those thoughts. However, I‚Äôd deeply appreciate more tips and goals on how to overcome these attachment issues, since I want to regain control of my life. Thanks in advance for your help peeps, and stay safe doing these troubled times.",justkindoflost,5

Whenever I am around people I try to mask the fact that I am feeling sad, in order to blend in.

2019-06-15 03:19:03,reddit_post,"This may sound counterproductive, but the hardest thing about the hoarding home are my own personal habits and antisocial behavior. I never leave the home all that frequently. That last time was during high school 10 years ago. To me, schooling (with all the stress and hell) was *the only* escape from this nightmare (temporarily) due to its forced nature.

I took the easiest/slow paced courses so that the stress would not over load my routine. I never had friends, I never dated, and I never did anything away from the routine.

At 19, my parents and doctors pushed a label of autism/aspergers onto me due to my social avoidance. No one except me knew why I did the things because the hoarding life style was never brought up. I was way too scared.

In college, my goal was to get a degree that made at least $15 per hour. I did engineering, computer science, and accounting. However, due to the habits of the hoarding home (isolation, procrastination, avoidance) I struggled in my classes. I never believed I would get hired. 

I mold myself to the environment. Shit everywhere and no ability to clean it up? I will out shit your shit. 

So effectively I am the biggest pig in this home. I never bathe, I hardly change clothing, I eat extremely messily on the floor (no table). When I spill food I hardly clean it up(roach food now). And I never interact socially with the world.

See the thing is, as a coping mechanism, I cannot improve myself in this hoarding environment. So I just become even more disgusting than this miserable place. 

It is like, why would you wear a tuxedo to an oil rigging site? I constantly feel like I am submerged in gunk. 

My schedule for the last 7 years: go to bed late, wake up whenever, eat lots of food, get depressed, read about what I am missing out on, get FOMO,  read reddit/watch anime/watch YouTube, watch porn, get even more depressed, find something motivational, try to break habits, streak goes on for a few weeks until I feel suicidal, try to kill myself or scream at my parents, cope by relapsing on my habits, repeat.

And as long as I live in this hoarding home, I will have zero friends and most likely die a virgin.

My mom is an intense hoarder and I dealt with it for 22 years. Saving money and moving out into my own place helped my mental health DRASTICALLY. Any mess I made was mine, and I had complete control over the situation on whether I chose to keep the mess or not. Believe it or not it made all the difference. I finally had the willpower to clean and make it right. The apartment is mine and I owed it to myself. After leaving, the stress of it all was lifted from my shoulders and I haven't looked back since.

Work on one degree right now. Take the initiative to do your best and make something of yourself. You don't have to accept your life as it is. You have total control.

2019-08-30 13:20:34,reddit_post,"Rejection/Failure coping help Hey guys, 

Just wanted some advice and motivation on how to tackle some of my current problems.

2016-11-15 03:35:55,reddit_post,"University dropout with a trust fund: unmotivated and depressed Surprised that I'm even writing this. Because I am SO unmotivated. It's 3 PM on a Monday and I just woke up. I'm a 22 year old unemployed female university dropout with no plans for my future or even getting employment.  You would think that I'd get motivated from others constantly asking me about my ""job hunt"". But I'm so ashamed of admitting my laziness that I lie to them and say I have a bunch of interviews to go to etc. I then get anxiety over lying to them. (Parents, friends) . I also feel like I'm isolating myself from my loved ones because I don't want them asking me questions about my future/ don't want to lie to them so I just avoid encountering them in general. (Not eating dinner with my dad anymore because he keeps pestering me and I don't want to admit that I'm an unmotivated person because he would associate that with ungratefulness) 

Usually for me I get motivated if there is a purpose but lately I'm having trouble waking up early because there is no purpose. I have no where to go and I have no motivation to find anywhere to go. I only wake up early if I make plans with someone and someone is counting on me being there early. 

I don't have a job and I'm unmotivated to get one because I have $$$ in my trust fund. I stopped going to the gym because the body acceptance movement really spoke to me. I dropped out of university because good grades weren't enough of a reason to motivate me to study for exams so I ended up failing and just dropping out entirely. I bought a book to inspire me to get motivated but I can't even bring myself to read it. (It's an ebook and on my iPad so every few pages I get distracted by YouTube/other apps on my iPad). After much procrastinating, I finally took driving school after 2 years. I completed the in class portion but I can't even get motivated to book my in car driving lessons which I've already paid for (out of the money from my trust fund). 

Even this past summer I got an internship (out of luck), and I had no motivation to complete the tasks at the job at hand. I did them hesitantly (after hours of procrastinating on social media at work). The moment my boss would leave the office, I'd go back to social media and YouTube etc. I feel like I've been like this since high school, and sometimes I think I might have ADHD. Or something. 

I remember in university, when I had readings to do for 3 classes. I found it incredibly difficult to finish one reading and then go on to the next, instead I went back and fourth between my 3 readings/textbooks till I finished them all at the same time by multitasking. In short: I get bored if I do the same task for a long time at once. I need a distraction. Another example: my mom asks me to unload the dishwasher. Halfway through unloading the dishwasher, I  feel the urge to wipe the countertops clean and ""distract myself"" and then I go back to the original task at hand which was unloading the damn dishwasher. 

I have been told by previous bosses and teachers that I should ""work on my listening skills."" I try my best but sometimes perhaps I don't have the patience to read through instructions that I just assume things and do them without proper listening/ instructions. And every single time i have to take a test/exam , for as long as I can remember, it would take me MUCH longer than my peers to finish, I'd always be asking for extra time to complete the test.  Do I have an undiagnosed learning disability? I don't know. 

Beforehand, I used to make excuses and blame my circumstances for my unmotivated laziness. I blamed the gym for being too far away as an excuse that I didn't work out. But this past summer I lived in a fancy new condo with a high class gym inside of it and I did not step foot in it once. I was THAT unmotivated. That's when I realized that my circumstances were NOT the problem. I could have the best of the best of the best and STILL be an unmotivated sloth. 

In terms of work/school, I used to think that the reason I was unmotivated was because I didn't find my ""passion"". So I spent two years searching for my ""passion"" and I found it. Now I know what I love, I know what I need to do, yet I'm still unmotivated to do those things and work towards goals. 

I have ""big plans"" for my future and I know what I want for myself but I have no motivation to take the steps needed to follow through. 

I don't know if I'd say that I'm depressed because I am happy. Despite some discontentment with my laziness, I am reasonably happy. However, I've read symptoms of depression.

These are the ones that apply to me:
-Insomnia
-Increase in appetite 
-Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or blaming yourself for things that aren't your responsibility
-Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things

That being said, I'm a fairly optimistic person and try not to let those symptoms bother me from being ""happy"" or doing things that make me happy (ie staying up till 4 AM binge watching Netflix and sleeping in and repeating the cycle all over again). I guess I'm happy because I'm finally doing ""whatever I want"" except I'm not happy doing this ""whatever I want"". Sometimes I don't even have enough patience to sit through an entire episode, so I scroll through Instagram while it's playing in the background. I always joke that I don't have the attention span to sit through super long movies which is why I avoid them. 

When I ask my friends to describe me, they'd say hyper and creative. And I agree with them. I'm 22 but act childish most of the time/ make inappropriate jokes. I also get bursts of creativity which motivates me to do the creative thing occasionally. 

I want structure in my life, I want a job that gives me purpose to wake up every morning, I want to be motivated to do things at the job, I want routine (despite originally saying 9-5 sucks), I want to feel motivated to apply and seek out the job that I want. 

I have all these grand plans for my future and what I want to do and where I want to go and when I see someone else (friends of mine) doing those things on social media I get jealous, insecure, self hatred consumes me ex: ""THAT WAS MY IDEA FIRST UHHHH"",  and feelings of extreme FOMO.

World of Reddit: how do I get motivated? How do I find purpose ? Can you be depressed and happy at the same time? Do I have ADHD? What's wrong with me? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated. 

I would go to a therapist but I'm paranoid/afraid that if I reveal that I have a trust fund, they might take advantage of vulnerable rich unmotivated me. ",Tp333,1
