An analysis on fear of missing out on platform YouTube and Reddit

This project aimed to find out the phenomenon of fear of missing out on online platforms.

What this research involves?

  This research consist of data scraping (with API), data cleansing and processing (pandas, nltk, etc.), data visualizing and analysis (matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud), and a report for coursework.

Why you do this?ua
  For a while I have this thought in my mind that the pandemic have changed so much that the impact of digital spaces started to influence more, as well as spreading emotions. And with the opportunity from coursework, I started to investigate out.

Why only YouTube and Reddit?
  First I think these two platform represented the two major types of social spaces, annonymous and creator centric.
  Also, these two platforms provide API for scraping. I have tried using tools like scrapy and selenium. But considering ethics and difficulty to get enough and qualified data, I use API instead.

What are the challenges dealing with these data?
  As raw data directly get from the internet, they really trained my data cleansing skills and the insight to data sets. Thinking how to represent my findings and make them easy to understand is difficult.
