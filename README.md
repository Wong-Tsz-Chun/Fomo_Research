# Fomo_Research

An analysis on the phenomenon of fear of missing out (FOMO) on online platforms YouTube and Reddit.

## Description

This project aimed to explore the impact of FOMO on online platforms during the pandemic. By investigating YouTube and Reddit, this research delves into how digital spaces influence emotions and behaviors.

## What This Research Involves

The research includes the following steps:
- **Data Scraping**: Using APIs to collect data from YouTube and Reddit.
- **Data Cleansing and Processing**: Utilizing tools like `pandas`, `nltk`, and more to clean and process the datasets.
- **Data Visualization and Analysis**: Leveraging `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `wordcloud` to visualize and interpret findings.
- **Report Writing**: Summarizing insights for coursework purposes.

## Motivation

The pandemic has drastically changed the way people interact in digital spaces. These changes have amplified the spread of emotions online, including the fear of missing out. With an opportunity provided by coursework, I decided to investigate this phenomenon further.

## Why Only YouTube and Reddit?

- These two platforms represent two major types of social spaces:
  - **YouTube**: A creator-centric platform.
  - **Reddit**: An anonymous, community-based platform.
- Both provide APIs for ethical and efficient data scraping.
- Although I considered tools like `scrapy` and `selenium`, using APIs ensured ethical data collection and access to high-quality datasets.

## Challenges

Working with raw data presented several challenges:
- **Data Cleansing**: The raw datasets from the internet required significant cleaning and preprocessing to make them usable.
- **Insight Development**: Extracting meaningful insights from the data required careful thought and advanced data processing skills.
- **Data Representation**: Visualizing findings in an understandable and engaging way was one of the most difficult aspects of the project.
